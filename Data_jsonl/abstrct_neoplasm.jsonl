{"id": "10210927", "text": "Data from experimental studies suggest that octreotide, the long acting somatostatin analogue, improves survival of animals with pancreatic cancer. To assess the antitumour effect of octreotide, a randomized trial was performed comparing octreotide with supportive care in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. All patients, aged 59-75 years, were not liable to radical surgical treatment and were not submitted to other treatments (chemo and/or radiotherapy). Six patients were enrolled, 4 of these treated with octreotide (500 micrograms two times a day subcutaneous for six months) and the other 2 were inserted a control group. The patients treated with octreotide showed a significant advantage in quality of life (restored appetite, improvement of digestion and intestine function, remission of abdominal pain and preservation of baseline body weight) with a mean > 80 of karnofsky performance score. Monitoring of tumour size changes (US-TC) over the 6 months study period, showed slackened neoplastic growth in all treated patients, whereas neoplasm grew according to an almost exponential trend in untreated patients. Also survival was better in treated patients: in particular, 2 patients out of 4 who completed the study underwent follow-up until they died 12 and 16 months after beginning of treatment, respectively. Karnofsky performance score was particularly high in both patients. This supports the view that octreotide is endowed with antiproliferative activity.

Unfortunately, arguments have often been put forward in favor of one or other of the two methods, but without the performance of an objective, randomized investigation. To resolve this situation, the authors have carried out a multicenter, randomized prospective study of selected patients with a view to deciding which method affords better results in complex tumor therapy from the aspects of survival and postoperative quality of life. One hundred thirty-one patients with operable sublingual or lingual squamous cell carcinoma in stages T2NXM0 to T4MXM0 were randomized into 2 groups: 1 group participated in preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin and epirubicin (total doses: 200 mg cisplatin, 120 mg epirubicin) via the external carotid artery, whereas the other group received preoperative radiation therapy (46 grays). Following subsequent radical surgery, the patients received regular follow-up for 5 years. By the end of the 5 years, 95 of the 131 patients had conformed to the protocol. Of those 95, 47 had received preoperative chemotherapy and 48 preoperative irradiation. After 5 years, 18 of the 47 patients who received chemotherapy and 15 of the 48 patients who received irradiation were still alive and tumor free. A few more patients had died of recurrence or regional metastasis in the chemotherapy group (23 patients) than in the irradiation group (20 patients).

{"id": "10930797", "text": "The aim of the project was to identify clinical and quality of life (QL) factors that together predict survival and response to chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer. Potential prognostic factors were studied in 187 women with baseline QL data from a trial of paclitaxel versus doxorubicin as first-line chemotherapy. Demographic and clinical factors studied were age, performance status, dominant site of disease and preceding disease-free interval (DFI). Factors from the EORTC QLQ-C30 were all function scales, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, loss of appetite and global QL. The proportional hazards regression model with stratification for treatment, and the logistic regression model adjusting for treatment arm were used for univariate and multivariate analyses of survival and response to treatment, respectively. For survival, multiple sites of visceral disease, pain, global QL and fatigue were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis. The final multivariate model predicted poor survival with multiple sites of visceral disease (P=0.003), DFI </=2 years (P=0.026) and pain (P=0.003). For response, age, dyspnoea, fatigue and global QL were significant predictive factors in the univariate analysis.

Patients in the PCDE arm had a statistically significant higher frequency of combined complete plus partial responses compared with those in the EP arm (21% plus 55% versus 13% plus 48%, respectively; P =.02 for difference in combined objective responses). Patients in the PCDE arm survived longer than those in the EP arm (1-year survival rate: 40% and 29%, respectively; median survival: 10.5 and 9.3 months, respectively; log-rank P =.0067). In the Cox model, the relative risk of death for patients in the PCDE arm compared with those in the EP arm was 0.70 (95% confidence interval = 0.51 to 0.95); the disease also progressed more slowly in patients in the PCDE arm. Hematologic toxicity was higher in the PCDE arm (22% with documented infections compared with 8% in the EP arm; P =.0038), and the toxicity-related death rate was 9% in the PCDE arm versus 5.5% in the EP arm (P =.22).

The study was designed as a 2 x 2 factorial trial. The aim was to rule out a 5% decrease in the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The study included the assessment of patient quality of life. A cycle of BEP consisted of etoposide 500 mg/m(2), administered at either 100 mg/m(2) days 1 through 5 or 165 mg/m(2) days 1 through 3, cisplatin 100 mg/m(2), administered at either 20 mg/m(2) days 1 through 5 or 50 mg/m(2) days 1 and 2. Bleomycin 30 mg was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 during cycles 1 through 3. The randomization procedure allowed some investigators to participate only in the comparison of three versus four cycles. From March 1995 until April 1998, 812 patients were randomly assigned to receive three or four cycles: of these, 681 were also randomly assigned to the 5-day or the 3-day schedule. Histology, marker values, and disease extent are well balanced in the treatment arms of the two comparisons. The projected 2-year PFS is 90.4% on three cycles and 89.4% on four cycles. The difference in PFS between three and four cycles is -1.0% (80% confidence limit [CL], -3.8%, +1.8%). Equivalence for three versus four cycles is claimed because both the upper and lower bounds of the 80% CL are less than 5%. In the 5- versus 3-day comparison, the projected 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively (difference, -0.9%, (80% CL, -4.1%, +2.2%). Hence, equivalence is claimed in this comparison also. Frequencies of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were essentially similar. Quality of life was maintained better in patients receiving three cycles; no differences were detected between 3 and 5 days of treatment.

This prospective randomized phase-III trial (CAO/ARO/AIO-94) compares the efficacy of neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy to standard postoperative radiochemotherapy. We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of radiochemotherapy and postoperative morbidity. Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer (uT3/4 or uN+, Mason CS III/IV) were randomly assigned to pre- or postoperative radiochemotherapy: A total dose of 50.4 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy) was applied to the tumor and the pelvic lymph nodes. 5-FU (1,000 mg/m2/d) was administered concomitantly in the first and fifth week of radiation as 120-h continuous infusion. Four additional cycles of 5-FU chemotherapy (500 mg/m2/d, i.v. bolus) were applied. Radiochemotherapy was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy in the postoperative setting. Time interval between radiochemotherapy and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms. Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision. In addition, stratification according to surgeons involved has been provided for.

The study also explored a possible relationship between increased hemoglobin and survival. Three hundred seventy-five patients with solid or nonmyeloid hematologic malignancies and hemoglobin levels < or = 10.5 g/dL, or greater than 10.5 g/dL but < or = 12.0 g/dL after a hemoglobin decrease of > or = 1.5 g/dL per cycle since starting chemotherapy, were randomized 2:1 to epoetin alfa 150 to 300 IU/kg (n = 251) or placebo (n = 124) three times per week subcutaneously for 12 to 24 weeks. The primary end point was proportion of patients transfused; secondary end points were change in hemoglobin and QOL. The protocol was amended before unblinding to prospectively collect and assess survival data 12 months after the last patient completed the study. Epoetin alfa, compared with placebo, significantly decreased transfusion requirements (P =.0057) and increased hemoglobin (P <.001). Improvement of all primary cancer- and anemia-specific QOL domains, including energy level, ability to do daily activities, and fatigue, was significantly (P <.01) greater for epoetin alfa versus placebo patients.

The resulting quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWIST) was compared between randomized groups, and sensitivity (threshold) analyses to the choice of utility coefficients was performed. Over 73 months after randomization, the fludarabine group gained a mean of 45 days of toxicity-free survival at CAP, and 61 days over ChOP. The mean TWIST was 27.05 months with CAP, 31.5 months with ChOP and 32.95 months with fludarabine.

The treatment plan consisted of 3 cycles of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin, fluorouracil (5-FU), l-leucovorin and interferon alpha2b (PFL-IFN) followed by 7 cycles of 5-FU, hydroxyurea and concomitant radiation for 5 days (FHX) for a total radiation dose of 70 Gy. 13 Cis-retinoic acid was added to treatment regimen for chemoprevention and a systematic prophylaxis of mucositis was administered to all patients during FHX. Conservative surgical resection was reserved to patients with no optimal response (PR > or =70%), whereas radical surgery was performed as salvage treatment. Twenty-six patients were treated at one institution: more than 90% had stage IV disease and only 19.2% had laryngeal cancer. Eighty-one percent of patients had performance status 0 and 23.1% of patients had >5% weight loss at the start of treatment. Nineteen patients were analyzed for response to PFL-IFN: 3/19 (15.8%) patients achieved a CR and 7/19 (36.8%) achieved a PR for an ORR of 52.6%. FHX was administered on protocol to 12 patients: 6 patients (50%) had CR, 1 patient (8.3%) had PR for an ORR of 58.3%, 2 patients (16.7%) had SD and 3 patients (25%) had PD.

However, imperative stool urge, stool fragmentation, prolonged stooling sessions, and minor problems of incontinence are frequently observed in the postoperative situation and negatively affect quality of life. Therefore, the colonic J-pouch was originally constructed to create a stool reservoir. In a randomized, prospective study, the short (5 cm) colonic J-pouch was tested for function and continence vs. straight coloanal anastomosis. Over a period of 30 months, 74 consecutive patients (55 males) with rectal cancer in the lower and middle third of the rectum were included and randomized into two groups. Anastomosis was performed either as a coloanal or a colon-pouch-anal anastomosis. The standardized surgical procedure included mobilization of the left hemicolon, central ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery and vein, preaortal lymph node dissection, autonomic nerve preservation, and total mesorectal excision. The anastomosis was performed at the upper anal canal or at the intersphincteric level. All patients were evaluated preoperatively and six months postoperatively for fecal continence, including sphincter manometry and defecation habits. In addition, quality of life was determined by use of a standardized questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer, EORTC-QLQ-C30). Thirty-seven patients were randomized into each group. In general, problems with continence for liquids or gas occurred less frequently in the colonic J-pouch group 6 months after surgery. The frequency of bowel movements was lower in the J-pouch group (2.5 per day) than in the coloanal group (4.7 per day). Importantly, in a manometric study at the same postoperative point, neorectal capacity was decreased to a similar degree in both groups compared with the preoperative rectal volume. Thus, the expected and postulated reservoir effect could not be achieved by forming a 5-cm colonic J-pouch. The colonic J-pouch was superior with regard to continence for gas and liquids compared with a straight coloanal anastomosis. Furthermore, stool frequency was significantly lower in the J-pouch group than in the coloanal reconstruction group.

The present study aimed to compare FUP with 5-FU alone, which was the control arm in former Mayo Clinic trials. Patients with untreated cytologically or histologically proven metastatic or locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were deemed measurable or evaluable. Chemotherapy regimens consisted of a control FU arm (5-FU 500 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days) and the investigational FUP arm (continuous 5-FU 1000 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days plus cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) on day 1 or day 2). In both arms, chemotherapy was repeated at day 29. Two-hundred and seven patients from 18 centres were randomised: 103 in the FU arm and 104 in FUP arm.

In advanced pancreatic carcinomas with a poor prognosis, FUP was superior to FU in terms of response and progression-free survival, but not in terms of overall survival.

{"id": "12243809", "text": "To compare the outcome of treatment of mediastinoscopy-verified N2 non-small-cell lung cancer treated with induction chemotherapy followed by either surgery or radiotherapy (RT), with both options followed by consolidation chemotherapy. A randomized Phase III trial for Stage IIIA (T1-T3N2M0) non-small cell lung cancer was conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group between April 1990 and April 1994. After documentation of N2 disease by mediastinoscopy or anterior mediastinotomy, patients received induction chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and mitomycin-C. Mitomycin-C was later dropped from the induction regimen. Patients were then randomized to surgery or RT (64 Gy in 7 weeks) followed by cisplatin and vinblastine. RTOG 89-01 accrued 75 patients, of whom 73 were eligible and analyzable. Twelve patients received induction chemotherapy but were not randomized to RT or surgery thereafter. Forty-five patients were randomized to postinduction RT or surgery. Of the analyzable patients, 90% had a Karnofsky performance score of 90-100, 18% had weight loss >5%, 37% had squamous cell histologic features, and 54% had bulky N2 disease. The distribution of bulky N2 disease was uniform among the treatment arms. The incidence of Grade 4 toxicity was 56% in patients receiving mitomycin-C and 29% in those who did not. Only 1 patient in each group had acute nonhematologic toxicity greater than Grade 3 (nausea and vomiting). No acute Grade 4 radiation toxicity developed. The incidences of long-term toxicity were equivalent across the arms. Three treatment-related deaths occurred: 2 patients in the surgical arms (one late pulmonary toxicity and one pulmonary embolus), and 1 patient in the radiation arm (radiation pneumonitis). Induction chemotherapy was completed in 78% of the patients. Complete resection was performed in 73% of 26 patients undergoing thoracotomy. Consolidation chemotherapy was completed in 75% of the patients. No statistically significant difference was found among the treatment arms. The overall progression-free survival rate was 53% at 1 year and 17% at 3 years. The median progression-free survival was 14 months. No difference in the 1-year survival rate (70% vs. 66%) or median survival time (19.4 vs. 17.4 months) between the surgery and RT arms. The median survival in the patients receiving induction chemotherapy only was 8.9 months. Mitomycin-C had no impact on survival (p = 0.75). No statistically significant difference was noted in the time to local failure between the surgical and RT arms. The patient accrual to this trial made its results inconclusive, but several observations are notable. In this trial, histologic confirmation of N2 disease in the surgical and nonsurgical arms eliminated the usual biases from clinical staging.

This is, in part, because scales and measures of QOL are still relatively unfamiliar to most clinicians and because population-based reference ranges are lacking, thus making clinical trial results difficult to interpret. To aid in the interpretation of QOL results from clinical trials, we administered the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) QOL instrument to a nationally representative sample of 1,400 people using an Internet survey panel in the United States. We then compared the FACT-An data from the Internet survey with the QOL data of a 375-patient randomized, double-blind clinical trial evaluating epoetin alfa versus placebo in anemic cancer patients.

We report on the design of the study and first results with regard to toxicity of RCT and postoperative morbidity. Patients with locally advanced operable rectal cancer (uT3/4 or uN+, Mason CS III/IV) were randomly assigned to pre or postoperative RCT: A total dose of 50.4 Gy (single dose 1.8 Gy) was applied to the tumour and the pelvic lymph nodes. 5-FU (1000 mg/m2/d) was administered concomitantly in the 1th and 5th week of radiation as 120 h-continuous infusion. Four additional cycles of 5-FU-chemotherapy (500 mg/m2/d, i.v.-bolus) were applied. RCT was identical in both arms except for a small-volume boost of 5.4 Gy postoperatively. The time interval between RCT and surgery was 4-6 weeks in both arms. Techniques of surgery were standardized and included total mesorectal excision. Primary endpoints of the study are 5-year survival and local and distant control. Secondary endpoints include the rate of curative (R0) resection and sphincter saving procedures, toxicity of RCT, surgical complications and quality of life.

To determine the incremental cost utility of epoetin-alfa versus placebo in anaemic patients with stage IV breast cancer from a UK National Health Service perspective. Patient data regarding transfusions, epoetin-alfa usage, chemotherapy treatment cycles, and adverse events were recorded, with survival follow-up for 12-36 months post-study. Stage IV breast cancer therapy costs were collected by surveying UK oncologists, and utilities for associated health states were from published sources. Costs were in British pounds and year 2000 values. Costs and benefits were jointly determined for the stage IV breast cancer subgroup (n = 55). Incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs) were calculated assuming a 6% annual discount rate for costs and a 1.5% annual discount rate for benefits. Bootstrap simulations (10,000 iterations) were conducted to account for uncertainty, and sensitivity analyses were conducted to establish robustness.

Chemotherapy seems to improve symptoms control, even if randomised studies with quality of life as first endpoint are lacking and often chemotherapy toxicity compromises the frail cost/benefit ratio. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the impact on QoL, substituting cisplatin, a pivot drug in NSCLC therapy, with carboplatin, an analogue with an improved toxicity profile. The combination of cisplatin with Mitomycin and Vinblastine was one of the most frequently used in the palliative setting at the time of design of our study. Patients were randomized to receive MVP regimen (Mitomycin-C 8 mg/m2 d1, Vinblastine 4 mg/m2 d 1-8, Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 d1) or MVC regimen (Mitomycin-C 8 mg/m2 d1, Vinblastine 4 mg/m2 d 1-8, Carboplatin 300 mg/m2 d1) every 3 weeks. The QoL was evaluated by the Spitzer QL-Index and by the EORTC QLQ-C30+LC 13 questionnaires before chemotherapy, after one cycle, after three cycles, and then every 6 weeks in the first 6 months and every 3 months thenafter. From September 1994 to July 1997, 153 consecutive patients were randomized to MVP (75 patients) or MVC arm (78 patients). Despite difficulties in carrying out and analysing QoL items in such patients, the global QoL evaluated by the Spitzer's questionnaire suggested an advantage for MVC regimen (P=0.05) and a significant difference was observed in global health subdomain (P=0.04). The disease-related symptoms improved with time, and the benefits lasted for the entire treatment period. When evaluated with the EORTC questionnaire there was significantly less nausea and vomiting (P=0.0001), appetite loss (P=0.01), insomnia (P=0.03), constipation (P=0.01) and peripheral neuropathy (P=0.01) in favour of MVC, and a trend for less hair loss (P=0.05). The advantage lasted for all the duration of chemotherapy. No differences were observed in global quality of life subdomain (P=0.40) between the two regimen. QoL was the first endpoint and the statistical power was inadequate to assess other parameters. However, we reported a response rate of 43.1 and 38.6%, respectively, in MVP and MVC arm (P=0.59) and a median survival of 10.2 and 7.2 months, respectively, for cisplatin and carboplatin arm (P=0.39). The carboplatin containing regimen (MVC) has a significant better toxicity profile than the cisplatin containing (MVP) regimen as proven both by the EORTC questionnaires and by the WHO toxicity data reported by physicians. No significant differences in terms of response rate, time to progression and overall survival were observed between the two regimen. The two chemotherapy regimen showed a similar effectiveness in symptom palliation when evaluated with C30 addendum of EORTC QOL questionnaire. With the Spitzer's questionnaires a trend towards an improved quality of life index was observed during treatment with the carboplatin combination in comparison to the cisplatin combination.

However, these guidelines can be questioned with regard to the extent of efficacy as well as the rationale for not using strong opioids as first-line treatment, especially in terminal cancer patients. The purpose of this randomized study was to prospectively compare the efficacy and tolerability of strong opioids as first-line agents with the recommendations of the WHO in terminal cancer patients. One hundred patients with mild-moderate pain were randomized to treatment according to WHO guidelines or to treatment with strong opioids. Evaluated outcomes included pain intensity, need for change in therapy, quality of life, Karnofsky Performance Status, general condition of the patient, and adverse events. No between-treatment differences were observed for changes in quality of life or performance status, but patients started on strong opioids had significantly better pain relief than patients treated according to WHO guidelines (P=0.041).

We compared HRQoL between the two treatments and analysed changes in HRQoL during follow-up. Dysphagia improved more rapidly after stent placement than after brachytherapy, but long-term relief of dysphagia was better after brachytherapy. For generic HRQoL, there was an overall significant difference in favour of brachytherapy on four out of five functional scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 (role, emotional, cognitive and social) (P < 0.05). Generic HRQoL deteriorated over time on all functional scales of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and EQ-5D, in particular physical and role functioning (on average -23 and -24 on a 100 points scale during 0.5 years of follow-up). This decline was more pronounced in the stent group. Major improvements were seen on the dysphagia and eating scales of the EORTC OES-23, in contrast to other scales of this disease-specific measure, which remained almost stable during follow-up.

{"id": "15472910", "text": "Kaposi's sarcoma is currently the most common tumor in Zimbabwe. The purpose of our study is to compare the effectiveness of supportive care vs. 3 intervention approaches, namely oral Etoposide, a 3-drug combination, and radiotherapy using quality of life (QOL) as the primary measure of success. In addition, our study was to determine whether a disease-specific module has greater sensitivity to group differences than a generic QOL questionnaire and to determine the most pragmatic approach to treating epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma (EKS) in Zimbabwe. Histologically confirmed HIV-positive patients with Kaposi's sarcoma were randomized to receive supportive care only or supportive care plus either radiotherapy, oral Etoposide or a 3-drug combination consisting of actinomycin-D, vincristine and bleomycin. No patient received antiretroviral therapy. The primary outcome was QOL measured by the functional living index-cancer (FLI-C) and supplemented by the Kaposi's sarcoma module (KSM). From 1994-1999, 495 EKS patients were accrued, and 470 were evaluable. Of these, 433 are known to be dead, 26 are lost to follow-up and 11 are still alive. The group treated with oral Etoposide had a significantly better QOL than the radiotherapy group for the total FLI-C score (adjusted mean plus standard error at 3-months 89 +/- 3 vs. 76 +/- 3; p = 0.004) and for the hardship (11 +/- 0.4 vs. 9 +/- 0.4; p = 0.001); social (10 +/- 0.4 vs. 8 +/- 0.4; p = 0.001) and nausea (9 +/- 0.4 vs. 8 +/- 0.4; p = 0.002) subscales. In addition, on the physical and psychological subscales, the Etoposide group had a significantly better QOL than the other 3 treatment groups (p < 0.04). The 3-drug combination, supportive care and radiotherapy groups did not differ significantly from each other with respect to the total FLI-C score or its subscales. There were no group differences with respect to survival. Oral Etoposide therapy resulted in better total FLI-C QOL score than radiotherapy.

{"id": "16524633", "text": "Morbidity is an important issue in cancer research. The observer-based toxicity scoring system used by DAHANCA (the Danish head and neck cancer study group) has proved itself sensitive to differences in toxicity in a large randomised study, but like other toxicity scoring systems it has not been formally validated. Conversely, the EORTC quality of life questionnaire (QLQ) has been validated as a tool for collecting information about the consequences of disease and treatment on the well being of cancer patients. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the two methods of side effect recording. One hundred and sixteen recurrence free patients with laryngeal (n=44), pharyngeal (n=34) and oral cavity (n=38) cancer attending follow-up after radiotherapy (n=83) or surgery (n=33) completed EORTC C30, the core questionnaire concerning general symptoms and function and EORTC H&amp;N35 the head and neck specific questionnaire. The attending physicians in the follow-up clinic evaluated and recorded DAHANCA toxicity scores on the same patients. The DAHANCA toxicity scoring system and the EORTC QLQ correlated with several clinical endpoints. The conceptually similar endpoints of the two methods correlated significantly. The objective endpoints of the DAHANCA scoring system were only correlated with quality of life endpoints to a very low degree. The DAHANCA toxicity scores had a low sensitivity (0.48-0.74) in detecting equivalent subjective complaints from the questionnaires and the observer-based scoring system severely underestimated patient complaints.

However, CDPT demands substantial time and effort from patients to maintain these benefits; the treatments are not always well-accepted, and patients may suffer from a deterioration in quality-of-life or a time-dependent loss of initial treatment benefits. A new device designed for home use by the patient, the Flexitouch, has been developed to mechanically simulate MLD. We have undertaken a prospective, randomized, crossover study of the efficacy of the Flexitouch, when compared to massage, in the self-administered maintenance therapy of lymphedema. A prospective, randomized, crossover study of maintenance therapy was performed in 10 patients with unilateral breast cancer-associated lymphedema of the arm. Each observation phase included self-administered treatment with the Flexitouch or massage, 1 hour daily for 14 days, respectively, followed by crossover to the alternate treatment phase. Each treatment phase was preceded by a 1 week treatment washout, with use of garment only. The sequence of treatment was randomly assigned. The potential impact of treatment modality on quality of life was assessed with serial administration of the SF-36. Statistical analysis disclosed that the order of treatment had no outcome influence, permitting 10 comparisons within each treatment group. Post-treatment arm volume reduced significantly after the Flexitouch, but not after self-administered massage. The patients' mean weight decreased significantly with Flexitouch use, but not with massage. The Flexitouch device was apparently well-tolerated and accepted by patients. Serial SF-36 administration showed no deterioration in physical or psychosocial scores compared to baseline measurements; there were no statistical differences in scores when the two treatment modalities were compared. This short-term prospective evaluation of the Flexitouch suggests that the device may provide better maintenance edema control than self-adiminstered massage in breast cancer-associated lymphedema.

{"id": "16981945", "text": "Radiation-induced mucositis is an acute reaction of the mucosa of patients undergoing head and neck radiotherapy. It can have debilitating and dose-limiting consequences. There is no consensus on an accepted intervention that significantly reduces its severity. Misoprostol is a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, with properties of a mucosal cytoprotectant. We designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of misoprostol in patients with head and neck cancer. The aim of this study was to determine if topical misoprostol was effective in reducing the severity of radiation-induced mucositis in patients receiving radical dose radiotherapy. The effect of this intervention on a patient's general well-being was also investigated. The primary end-point of the study was the incidence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 mucositis. Between 1999 and 2002, 83 patients were recruited into the study at Westmead and Nepean Hospitals, Sydney. Forty-two patients were randomized to receive misoprostol and 41 to receive a placebo. Most patients received radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting (52 of the 83) and had either an oral cavity (42 of the 83) or an oropharyngeal (16 of the 83) cancer. We could not identify any significant difference in the incidence of severe mucositis based on whether patients were allocated to receive misoprostol or placebo. There was no significant difference in the mean area under the mucositis curve (13.2 vs 16.6; P = 0.1). Patients allocated to misoprostol did report slightly increased soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and a greater use of analgesics.

We report QOL data collected during 3 years after random assignment in patients without disease recurrence. Overall, patients receiving goserelin alone showed a marked improvement or less deterioration in QOL measures over the first 6 months than those patients treated with CMF.

A clinical trial tests whether a psychological intervention for cancer patients can do so, and also tests two routes to achieve better health: (a) reducing patients' Emotional Distress, and/or (b) enhancing their functional immunity. Post-surgery, 227 breast cancer patients were randomized to intervention or assessment only Study Arms. Conducted in small groups, intervention sessions were offered weekly for 4 months and followed by monthly sessions for 8 months. Measures included psychological (distress), biological (immune), and health outcomes (performance status and evaluations of patient's symptomatology, including toxicity from cancer treatment, lab values) collected at baseline, 4 months, and 12 months. A path model revealed that intervention participation directly improved health (p<.05) at 12 months. These effects remained when statistically controlling for baseline levels of distress, immunity, and health as well as sociodemographic, disease, and cancer treatment variables. Regarding the mechanisms for achieving better health, support was found for an indirect effect of distress reduction. That is, by specifically lowering intervention patients' distress at 4 months, their health was improved at 12 months (p<.05). Although the intervention simultaneously improved patients' T-cell blastogenesis in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), the latter increases were unrelated to improved health. A convergence of biobehavioral effects and health improvements were observed. Behavioral change, rather than immunity change, was influential in achieving lower levels of symptomatology and higher functional status.

We aimed to identify the effects of an established antidepressant on these symptoms and survival in patients with advanced cancer who did not have major depression as assessed by clinicians. Between July, 2001, and February, 2006, 189 patients with advanced cancer were randomly assigned sertraline 50 mg (n=95), or placebo (n=94), once per day. The primary outcome was depression as assessed by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D); the main secondary outcomes were: anxiety as assessed by Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scales (HADS-A); overall quality of life and fatigue as assessed by Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General and Fatigue scales (FACT-G and FACT-F, respectively); and clinicians' ratings of quality of life by use of Spizter's Quality of Life Index (SQLI). Multiple measures were used for corroboration of the most important outcomes. Primary analyses were done by intention to treat and were based on scale scores at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. The benefits of sertraline compared with placebo are expressed on a range from +100 (ie, maximum benefit) to -100 (ie, maximum harm); a difference of 10 was deemed clinically significant.

Clinical benefit was prospectively evaluated in this trial as a secondary end point. The primary measure for clinical benefit analysis was time to definitive worsening by one or more categories of Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Secondary clinical benefit end points included time to 5% definitive weight loss, time to definitive worsening of appetite by one grade, pain-free survival (defined as time to first appearance of pain), and time to first cancer pain-related opioid intake. Clinical benefit assessments were recorded at each clinic visit. Clinical benefit assessments were performed in more than 75% of patients throughout V325. DCF significantly prolonged time to definitive worsening of KPS compared with CF (median, 6.1 v 4.8 months; hazard ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.76; log-rank P = .009). Although time to definitive weight loss and time to definitive worsening of appetite favored DCF, the results were not statistically significant.

A randomised controlled clinical trial, using a method of minimisation balanced by centre, grade of cancer, age, lymphatic/vascular invasion and preoperative endocrine therapy, was performed. A non-randomised cohort was also recruited, in order to complete a comprehensive cohort study. The setting was breast cancer clinics in cancer centres in the UK. Patients aged 65 years or more were eligible provided that their cancers were considered to be at low risk of local recurrence, were suitable for breast-conservation surgery, were receiving endocrine therapy and were able and willing to give informed consent. The standard treatment of postoperative breast irradiation or the omission of radiotherapy. Quality of life was the primary outcome measure, together with anxiety and depression and cost-effectiveness. Secondary outcome measures were recurrence rates, functional status, treatment-related morbidity and cosmesis. The principal method of data collection was by questionnaire, completed at home with a research nurse at four times over 15 months. The hypothesised improvement in overall quality of life with the omission of radiotherapy was not seen in the EuroQol assessment or in the functionality and symptoms summary domains of the European Organisation for Research in the Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) scales. Some differences were apparent within subscales of the EORTC questionnaires, and insights into the impact of treatment were also provided by the qualitative data obtained by open-ended questions. Differences were most apparent shortly after the time of completion of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy was then associated with increased breast symptoms and with greater fatigue but with less insomnia and endocrine side-effects. Patients had significant concerns about the delivery of radiotherapy services, such as transport, accommodation and travel costs associated with receiving radiotherapy. By the end of follow-up, patients receiving radiotherapy were expressing less anxiety about recurrence than those who had not received radiotherapy. Functionality was not greatly affected by treatment. Within the randomised controlled trial, the Barthel Index demonstrated a small but significant fall in functionality with radiotherapy compared with the no radiotherapy arm of the trial. Results from the non-randomised patients did not confirm this effect, however. Cosmetic results were better in those not receiving radiotherapy but this did not appear to be an important issue to the patients. The use of home-based assessments by a research nurse proved to be an effective way of obtaining high-quality data. Costs to the NHS associated with postoperative radiotherapy were calculated to be of the order of 2000 pounds per patient. In the follow-up in this study, there were no recurrences, and the quality of life utilities from EuroQol were almost identical. Although there are no differences in overall quality of life scores between the patients treated with and without radiotherapy, there are several dimensions that exhibit significant advantage to the omission of irradiation. Over the first 15 months, radiotherapy for this population is not a cost-effective treatment. However, the early postoperative outcome does not give a complete answer and the eventual cost-effectiveness will only become clear after long-term follow-up. Extrapolations from these data suggest that radiotherapy may not be a cost-effective treatment unless it results in a recurrence rate that is at least 5% lower in absolute terms than those treated without radiotherapy.

Ten common symptoms were assessed by self-report questionnaire administered to 1,614 consecutive patients at baseline and every 3 months during the first year of a double-blind, randomized trial of postmenopausal women with early hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Symptoms were categorized as none, mild, moderate, or severe. A hot flash score was calculated at each time point. Symptoms were analyzed by repeated-measures analysis of variance. Each time period was tested repeatedly against the baseline; an overall P value was assigned for each reported symptom. Compliance was excellent, with 7,286 questionnaires analyzed. Baseline symptom prevalence ranged from 2% (vaginal bleeding) to 60% to 70% (bone/muscle aches and low energy). There were no significant differences in vaginal bleeding, mood alteration, or low energy. Patients receiving tamoxifen had significantly more vaginal discharge (P < .0001). Exemestane patients reported more bone/muscle aches (P < .0001), vaginal dryness (P = .0004), and difficulty sleeping (P = .03). In both groups, the hot flash score peaked at 3 months and decreased thereafter. At 12 months, patients receiving tamoxifen had a significantly higher mean hot flash score (P = .03), with daily hot flashes increasing from baseline by 33% compared with a 7% increase from baseline with exemestane.

{"id": "18485819", "text": "Debilitating hot flushes and sleep dysfunction often affect survivors of breast cancer, most notably in those taking anti-oestrogen medications. Conventional treatments have been only partially effective in diminishing these issues, and some have serious risks. We did a pilot study to investigate our hypothesis that stellate-ganglion block can be a safe and effective treatment for hot flushes and sleep dysfunction in this patient population. 13 survivors of breast cancer (in remission) with severe hot flushes and night awakenings were treated with stellate-ganglion block at the anterolateral aspect of the C6 vertebra on the right side under fluoroscopy. Patients recorded hot flushes in a daily diary by use of the Hot-Flash Score, devised by Sloan and colleagues, and night awakenings by use of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Both instruments were used 1 week before the procedure [A40] and then weekly after the procedure for 12 weeks. We used the generalised-estimating-equations method to analyse the longitudinal measurements of the number of hot flushes and night awakenings over time. This method is a popular approach to analysing datasets that have repeated measures from the same person, and is robust because it does not need the complete distribution of the outcomes to be specified. This trial is registered on the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number register (ISRCTN14318565). There were no adverse events resulting from the stellate-ganglion block, although patients had temporary Horner's syndrome indicating the effectiveness of the block. Five patients had only one stellate-ganglion block and eight had two stellate-ganglion blocks. The total number of hot flushes decreased from a mean of 79.4 (SD 37.4) per week before the procedure to a mean of 49.9 (SD 39.9) per week during the first 2 weeks after the procedure (p=0.0002). The total number of hot flushes continued to decrease over the remaining follow-up period (weeks 3-12), and stabilised at a mean of 8.1 (SD 5.6) per week (p<0.0001). The number of very severe hot flushes was decreased to near zero by the end of the follow-up period (week 12; p<0.0001).

The nonparametric bootstrap method was used to quantify differences in mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) costs between the strategies. In total, 81 patients underwent UAE and 75 underwent hysterectomy. In the UAE group, 19 patients (23%) underwent secondary hysterectomies. The mean total costs per patient in the UAE group were significantly lower than those in the hysterectomy group ($11,626 vs $18,563; mean difference, -$6,936 [-37%], 95% CI: -$9,548, $4,281).

There was a significant difference in mean dysphagia grade between treatment arms 6 weeks following treatment (P=0.046), with worse swallowing reported by rigid stent-treated patients (mean dysphagia score difference=-0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.10 to -0.89, P=0.014). Global QL scores were lower at both 1 and 6 weeks following treatment for patients treated by SEMSs (mean difference QL index week 1=-0.66; 95% CI: -0.02 to -1.30, P=0.04; mean difference QL index week 6=-1.01; 95% CI -0.30 to -1.72, P=0.006). These findings were associated with higher post-procedure pain scores in the SEMS patient group (mean difference of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ C-30 pain symptom score at week 1=11.13; 95% CI: 2.89-19.4; P=0.01). Although mean EQ-5D QL values differed between the treatments (P<0.001), this difference dissipated following generation of quality-adjusted life year values. Total costs varied between treatment arms but these findings canceled out when SEMSs were compared with non-SEMS therapies (95% CI -845.15-1,332.62). These results were robust to sensitivity analysis. There were no differences in the in-hospital mortality or early complication rates, but late complications were more frequent after rigid stenting (risk ratio=2.47; 95% CI 1.88-3.04). There was a survival advantage for non-stent-treated patients (log-rank statistic=4.21, P=0.04).

Medical records were reviewed to determine toxicity and survival rates. Well-defined acute and late toxicities; functional outcomes (diet, dentition, tracheostomies); head and neck cancer-specific, general health, and depression outcomes; and survival rates. Most patients had oropharyngeal or laryngeal tumors (87.5%) and advanced-stage disease (75.0%). Approximately one-half had hematologic toxicities and toxicity-related treatment delays.

In addition, we also evaluated the impact of rhTSH (rhTSH vs. conventional thyroid hormone withdrawal) on quality of life (QoL) of thyroid cancer patients undergoing RI ablation. This study included three groups of patients, enrolled consecutively. From February 2006 to March 2007, 291 patients were enrolled and randomized, after total thyroidectomy: (1) withdrawal of levothyroxine (LT4) for 4 weeks (T4-WD Group, n = 89), (2) withdrawal of LT4 for 4 weeks plus 2 weeks on and then 2 weeks off liothyronine (LT3) (T3-WD Group, n = 133), and (3) rhTSH administration (rhTSH Group, n = 69). QoL was determined at the time of ablation. Patients in the three groups did not differ significantly in baseline characteristics or tumor, node and metastasis (TNM) staging.

Patients with gastric cancer, 3 months to 3 years postoperatively, were surveyed using the survey instrument. Postoperative dysfunction scores and the status of resuming activities of daily living were compared with the surgical procedure performed by analysis of variance and multiple-comparison techniques. Of 211 patients surveyed, 165 (119 men, 46 women; mean age, 65.1 \u00b1 10.5 years) responded. Procedures included distal gastrectomy in 100, total gastrectomy in 57, and pylorus-preserving gastrectomy in 8. The overall dysfunction score was 61.8 \u00b1 15.5. The dysfunction score was 58.9 \u00b1 15.0 after distal gastrectomy, 66.8 \u00b1 14.1 after total gastrectomy, and 62.4 \u00b1 21.6 after pylorus-preserving gastrectomy. These values differed significantly among the groups (P = .007). Dysfunction scores according to postoperative activity status were 49.1 \u00b1 15.6 in 71 patients who resumed their activities, 56.9 \u00b1 15.7 in 39 patients with reduced activities, 57.3 \u00b1 8.8 in 15 patients with minimal activities, and 63.3 \u00b1 11.8 (P < .05) in 16 patients who did not resume activities because of poor physical condition.

Caregivers and patients are adversely affected. However, previous studies of coping skills training (CST) interventions have not been tested in patients with lung cancer nor have systematically included caregivers. This study tested the efficacy of a caregiver-assisted CST protocol in a sample of patients with lung cancer. Two hundred thirty-three lung cancer patients and their caregivers were randomly assigned to receive 14 telephone-based sessions of either caregiver-assisted CST or education/support involving the caregiver. Patients completed measures assessing pain, psychological distress, quality of life (QOL), and self-efficacy for symptom management; caregivers completed measures assessing psychological distress, caregiver strain, and self-efficacy for helping the patient manage symptoms. Patients in both treatment conditions showed improvements in pain, depression, QOL, and self-efficacy, and caregivers in both conditions showed improvements in anxiety and self-efficacy from baseline to four-month follow-up. Results of exploratory analyses suggested that the CST intervention was more beneficial to patients/caregivers with Stage II and III cancers, whereas the education/support intervention was more beneficial to patients/caregivers with Stage I cancer. Taken together with the broader literature in this area, results from this study suggest that psychosocial interventions can lead to improvements in a range of outcomes for cancer patients.

In the MRC OV05/EORTC 55955 collaborative trial, we aimed to establish the benefits of early treatment on the basis of increased CA125 concentrations compared with delayed treatment on the basis of clinical recurrence. Women with ovarian cancer in complete remission after first-line platinum-based chemotherapy and a normal CA125 concentration were registered for this randomised controlled trial. Clinical examination and CA125 measurement were done every 3 months. Patients and investigators were masked to CA125 results, which were monitored by coordinating centres. If CA125 concentration exceeded twice the upper limit of normal, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) by minimisation to early or delayed chemotherapy. Patients and clinical sites were informed of allocation to early treatment, and treatment was started as soon as possible within 28 days of the increased CA125 measurement. Patients assigned to delayed treatment continued masked CA125 measurements, with treatment commencing at clinical or symptomatic relapse.

Patients with advanced solid tumor cancers (n\u2009=\u2009153) were randomized to eight sessions of either the MCGP or SGP. They completed assessments of psychosocial, spiritual, and physical well-being pretreatment, midtreatment, and 2\u2009months post-treatment.

Results for functional outcome and quality of life are rarely reported beyond 10 years and are lacking from randomised settings. We report results for quality of life for men in the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group Study Number 4 (SPCG-4) after a median follow-up of more than 12 years. All living Swedish and Finnish men (400 of 695) randomly assigned to radical prostatectomy or watchful waiting in SPCG-4 from 1989 to 1999 were included in our analysis. An additional 281 men were included in a population-based control group matched for region and age. Physical symptoms, symptom-induced stress, and self-assessed quality of life were evaluated with a study-specific questionnaire. Longitudinal data were available for 166 Swedish men who had answered quality-of-life questionnaires at an earlier timepoint. 182 (88%) of 208 men in the radical prostatectomy group, 167 (87%) of 192 men in the watchful-waiting group, and 214 (76%) of 281 men in the population-based control group answered the questionnaire.

For men in SPCG-4, negative side-effects were common and added more stress than was reported in the control population. In the radical prostatectomy group, erectile dysfunction and urinary leakage were often consequences of surgery. In the watchful-waiting group, side-effects can be caused by tumour progression.

Results for quality of life, symptom palliation, and tolerability are presented here. After four cycles of platinum-based induction therapy, 663 patients with stage IIIB or stage IV NSCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1 were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) from March 15, 2005, to July 20, 2007, using the Pocock and Simon minimisation method to receive pemetrexed (500 mg/m(2) every 21 days; n=441) or placebo (n=222) plus best supportive care until disease progression. The primary efficacy data have been reported previously. Patients completed the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) at baseline, after each cycle, and post-discontinuation. Worsening of symptoms was defined as an increase of 15 mm or more from baseline on a 100 mm scale for each LCSS item. The primary outcome for these quality-of-life analyses was time to worsening of symptoms, analysed for all randomised patients. Baseline characteristics, including LCSS scores, were well balanced between groups. Baseline LCSS scores were low, indicating low symptom burden for patients without disease progression after completion of first-line treatment. Longer time to worsening was recorded for pain (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b776, 95% CI 0\u00b759-0\u00b799; p=0\u00b7041) and haemoptysis (HR 0\u00b758, 95% CI 0\u00b734-0\u00b797; p=0\u00b7038) with pemetrexed than with placebo; no other significant differences in analyses of time to worsening were noted.

Hormone replacement therapy is often either undesirable or contraindicated. Safe, effective non-hormonal treatments are needed. We investigated whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) can help breast cancer survivors to effectively manage HFNS. In this randomised controlled trial, we recruited women from breast clinics in London, UK, who had problematic HFNS (minimum ten problematic episodes a week) after breast-cancer treatment. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either usual care or usual care plus group CBT (1:1). Randomisation was done in blocks of 12-20 participants, stratifying by age (younger than 50 years, 50 years or older), and was done with a computer-generated sequence. The trial statistician and researchers collecting outcome measures were masked to group allocation. Group CBT comprised one 90 min session a week for 6 weeks, and included psycho-education, paced breathing, and cognitive and behavioural strategies to manage HFNS. Assessments were done at baseline, 9 weeks, and 26 weeks after randomisation. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean difference in HFNS problem rating (1-10) between CBT and usual care groups at 9 weeks after randomisation. Analysis of the primary endpoint was done by modified intention to treat. The trial is registered, ISRCTN13771934, and was closed March 15, 2011. Between May 5, 2009, and Aug 27, 2010, 96 women were randomly allocated to group CBT (n=47) or usual care (n=49).

We report a retrospective subanalysis of Asian patients enrolled in SATURN. Patients with advanced NSCLC with no evidence of progression after four cycles of chemotherapy were randomized to receive erlotinib 150 mg/day or placebo, until progressive disease or limiting toxicity.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly used as a primary treatment for patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who are not eligible for radical treatment options. ADT is also used in patients with PCa as neo-adjuvant hormone therapy to reduce prostate volume and down-stage the disease before radiotherapy with curative intent. The present study showed that ADT with the gonadotropin hormone-releasing hormone (GhRH) antagonist degarelix is non-inferior to combined treatment with the LHRH agonist goserelin and bicalutamide in terms of reducing prostate volume during the treatment period of 3 months. Degarelix treatment evokes, however, significantly better relief of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients having moderate and severe voiding problems. To assess the efficacy of monthly degarelix treatment for reduction of total prostate volume (TPV), relief of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and improvement of quality of life (QoL) in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) using monthly goserelin as active control.

For flare protection, goserelin-treated patients also received daily bicalutamide (50 mg) during the initial 28 days. Key trial variables monitored monthly were TPV (primary endpoint), serum testosterone, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Impact Index. In all, 175 patients completed the trial (96.1%). At week 12, changes in TPV for degarelix and goserelin were similar (-37.2% vs -39.0%) and met the predefined non-inferiority criterion.

Our primary sleep endpoint was global sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Secondary endpoints were the PSQI component scores. Planned subgroup analyses were also conducted.

{"id": "22705939", "text": "Older breast cancer survivors (BCSs) are at risk for late and long-term treatment effects on quality of life (QOL), including lower physical functioning and fear of recurrence. Two promising approaches to address this include dance/movement therapy and mindfulness. The purpose of this 2-group randomized controlled pilot feasibility study was to test short-term effects of a 12-week Mindful Movement Program (MMP) intervention combining mindfulness with self-directed movement on QOL and mindfulness in female BCSs 50 years or older and at 12 months or more following treatment. Consented participants were randomized to an experimental group (EG) (12 weekly MMP sessions) or a control group (no sessions). All completed questionnaires 3 times. The EG participants kept home practice diaries. Analysis was conducted after intervention for immediate effects on outcome variables and 6 weeks later for maintenance of effects. Participants (n = 49) ranged in age from 50 to 90 years (average, 65.6 years) and were at 9.8 years since diagnosis (range, 1-32 years), and the majority were white, unpartnered, and retired. After intervention, EG participants showed improved QOL via decreased fear of recurrence and increased mindfulness attitude. At 6 weeks, initial effects were retained.

The present study extends this work by evaluating separate and combined effects of stress management training and home-based exercise.

Outcomes were reassessed 6 and 12 weeks after chemotherapy started. Significance testing of group-by-time interactions in 286 patients who completed all assessments was used to evaluate intervention efficacy. Interaction effects for mental and physical well-being scores were not significant. Depression scores yielded a linear interaction comparing UCO and SMEX (p = 0.019), with decreases in SMEX but not UCO.

They were assigned by a computer-generated randomisation schedule, stratified by centre, to receive temozolomide (200 mg/m(2) on days 1-5 of every 28 days for up to six cycles), hypofractionated radiotherapy (34\u00b70 Gy administered in 3\u00b74 Gy fractions over 2 weeks), or standard radiotherapy (60\u00b70 Gy administered in 2\u00b70 Gy fractions over 6 weeks). Patients and study staff were aware of treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN81470623. 342 patients were enrolled, of whom 291 were randomised across three treatment groups (temozolomide n=93, hypofractionated radiotherapy n=98, standard radiotherapy n=100) and 51 of whom were randomised across only two groups (temozolomide n=26, hypofractionated radiotherapy n=25).

Intrusive thoughts were associated with higher levels of all symptoms at baseline and at the 12-month assessment.

Eligible patients had clear cell metastatic renal cell carcinoma, progressive disease after one approved systemic treatment, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0-1. 723 patients were stratified by ECOG PS and previous treatment and randomly allocated (1:1) to receive axitinib (5 mg twice daily; n=361) or sorafenib (400 mg twice daily; n=362). The primary endpoint was PFS assessed by a masked, independent radiology review committee. We assessed patient-reported outcomes using validated questionnaires. Baseline characteristics and development of hypertension on treatment were studied as prognostic factors. Efficacy was assessed in the intention-to-treat population, and safety was assessed in patients who received at least one dose of the study drug.

{"id": "23917308", "text": "Due to concerns of fragility fracture, exercise is a perceived contraindication for prostate cancer patients with bone metastases. These patients experience significant functional impairment and muscle atrophy, which may lead to an increased likelihood of skeletal complicaTIOns (i.e., pathological fracture, bone pain) and/or falls. Safe resistance exercise prescription may counteract this effect. The aim of this feasibility trial was to determine the safety and efficacy of resistance exercise by prostate cancer survivors with bone metastatic disease. Twenty men with established bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer were randomly assigned to a 12-week resistance exercise program in which exercise prescription was based on the location of bone lesions (n=10) or usual care (n=10). Outcomes included safety and tolerance of the exercise program, physical function, physical activity level, body composition, fatigue, quality of life and psychological distress. Outcomes were compared between groups using analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline values. Participants had significant disease load with 65% of participants presenting with two or more regions affected by bone metastases and an average Gleason score of 8.2\u00b10.9. Five participants (exercise=2; usual care=3) did not complete the intervention, three of which were due to advancing disease (exercise=2; usual care=1). No adverse events or skeletal complications occurred during the supervised exercise sessions. The exercise program was well tolerated as evidenced by high attendance (83%) and compliance rates (93%), and the ability of the participants to exercise at an intensity within the target range for cancer survivors (rating of perceived exertion =13.8\u00b11.5). The change in physical function (muscle strength \u223c11%; submaximal aerobic exercise capacity \u223c5% and ambulation \u223c12%), physical activity level (\u223c24%) and lean mass (\u223c3%) differed significantly between groups following the intervention, with favorable changes in the exercise group compared with the usual care group.

This single centre, randomised, controlled trial enrolled 30 cervical cancer patients who were clinically staged IA2 with lymph vascular invasion and IB according to the FIGO (International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics) classification, and underwent LRH or ARH between late 1999 and early 2004. Postoperative pain, as measured by a 10-point numerical rate scale, was considered the primary endpoint. Postoperative pain was assessed every six hours during a patient's usual postoperative care. Perioperative outcomes were also registered. Both surgical techniques were executed by the same surgical team. Secondary outcomes included intraoperative and other postoperative surgicopathological factors and 5-year survival rates. IA2 patients with lymphatic vascular space invasion and IB cervical cancer patients were randomised to either the LRH group (16 patients) or the ARH group (14 patients). Four patients (25%) in the LRH group and 5 patients (36%) in the ARH group presented with transoperative or serious postoperative complications.

This study evaluated short and long-term effects of supervised group exercise training on health-related quality of life and physical performance in patients, who were radically operated for lung cancer. A randomized, assessor-blinded, controlled trial was performed on 78 patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. The intervention group (IG, n=41) participated in supervised out-patient exercise training sessions, one hour once a week for ten weeks. The sessions were based on aerobic exercises with target intensity of 60-80% of work capacity, resistance training and dyspnoea management. The control group (CG, n=37) received one individual instruction in exercise training. Measurements consisted of: health-related quality of life (SF36), six minute walk test (6MWT) and lung function (spirometry), assessed three weeks after surgery and after four and twelve months. Both groups were comparable at baseline on demographic characteristic and outcome values. We found a statistically significant effect after four months in the bodily pain domain of SF36, with an estimated mean difference (EMD) of 15.3 (95% CI:4 to 26.6, p=0.01) and a trend in favour of the intervention for role physical functioning (EMD 12.04, 95% CI: -1 to 25.1, p=0.07) and physical component summary (EMD 3.76, 95% CI:-0.1 to 7.6, p=0.06).

This study addressed two questions: the dose-response relationship of Taxol in relapsed ovarian cancer and the safety of a short infusion given with premedication. Women with platinum-pretreated epithelial ovarian cancer and measurable recurrent disease were randomized in a bifactorial design to receive either 175 or 135 mg/m2 of Taxol over either 24 or 3 hours. Major end points were the frequency of significant HSRs and objective response rate. Secondary end points were progression-free and overall survival. Of 407 patients randomized, 391 were eligible and 382 assessable for response. Analysis was performed according to the bifactorial design. Severe HSRs were rare (1.5% patients) and were not affected by either dose or schedule. Response was slightly higher at the 175-mg/m2 dose (20%) than at 135 mg/m2 (15%), but this was not statistically significant (P = .2).

Two hundred six eligible patients were randomized between double-blind MPA 500 mg twice daily or placebo. Appetite (0 to 10 numerical rating scale), weight, and QL (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire [EORTC-QLQ-C30]) were assessed before the start of treatment (t = 0), and 6 weeks (t = 6) and 12 weeks (t = 12) thereafter. One hundred thirty-four patients (68 MPA and 66 placebo) were assessable at t = 6 and 99 patients (53 MPA and 46 placebo) at t = 12. A beneficial effect of MPA on appetite was observed after both 6 weeks (P = .008) and 12 weeks (P = .01) of treatment. After 12 weeks, a mean weight gain of 0.6 +/- 4.4 kg was seen in the MPA, versus an ongoing mean weight loss of 1.4 +/- 4.6 kg in the placebo group. This difference of 2.0 kg was statistically significant (P = .04). During the study, several areas of QL deteriorated in the total group of patients. With the exception of an improvement in appetite and possible also a reduction in nausea and vomiting, no measurable beneficial effects of MPA on QL could be demonstrated.

{"id": "8683634", "text": "Combined radiation therapy and chemotherapy after surgery, compared with postsurgical radiation therapy alone, has been shown to improve disease-free survival and overall survival significantly among patients with poor-prognosis (i.e., advanced stage disease or metastasis to regional lymph nodes) resectable rectal cancer. However, the combined therapy is associated with more toxic effects, raising the question of whether the benefits of the treatment justify its quality-of-life costs for the individual patient. To assess the trade-offs between improved survival and increased treatment toxicity, we reanalyzed data from a randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of combined adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy with adjuvant radiation therapy alone in the treatment of patients with poor-prognosis resectable rectal cancer. The data were from a North Central Cancer Treatment Group trial in which 204 patients with poor-prognosis rectal cancer were randomly assigned to receive either postoperative radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy. A quality-adjusted time without symptoms or toxicity (Q-TWiST) analysis was used to account for freedom from symptomatic disease and from early and late side effects of treatment. All reported P values are two-sided. As reported previously, the combined therapy reduced the risk of relapse by 34% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12%-50%; P = .0016) and reduced the overall death rate by 29% (95% CI = 7%-45%; P = .025) in comparison with adjuvant radiation therapy alone. In the 5 years following assignment to treatment, patients who received the combined therapy had more time with toxicity (3.1 months; 95% CI = 2.0-4.1 months), shorter survival after relapse (3.6 months less; 95% CI = 0.9-6.3 months less), and more TWiST (6.1 months; 95% CI = 0.2-12.0 months) than patients who received adjuvant radiation therapy alone. Despite an increase in the amount of time that individuals spent with early and late toxic effects, the Q-TWiST analysis indicated that the combined therapy conferred significantly greater benefit for a wide range of patient preferences about living with the toxicity of treatment or the symptoms of overt disease. Use of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy as an adjuvant to surgery for patients with poor-prognosis resectable rectal cancer is justified, since the improved outcome in terms of delayed recurrence and increased survival balances the time spent with early and late toxic effects.

Between January 1991 and February 1995, 61 patients with gastric cancer were randomized to either chemotherapy in addition to best supportive care or to best supportive care. Chemotherapy was allowed in the latter group if the supportive measures did not lead to palliation. Chemotherapy was the ELF-regimen consisting of 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and etoposide, or, in elderly patients with poor performance, a 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin regimen (FLv).

The intention of this study was to determine if the effects of oral etoposide therapy on survival and quality of life are equivalent to those of intravenous chemotherapy. In a randomized trial of palliative treatment in advanced SCLC, oral etoposide (100 mg given twice daily for 5 days) was compared with intravenous chemotherapy consisting of alternating cycles of cisplatin and etoposide (PE) and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV). Six cycles of chemotherapy were administered every 21 days in both regimens. Symptom control and quality of life were measured with the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist and a daily diary card. In January 1996, after 155 patients had been randomly assigned from a projected intake of 365 patients, an independent Data Monitoring Committee examined the interim results. Survival was determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the logrank test was used to compare treatments. For quality-of-life comparisons, average scores were calculated for each time point. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine any significant overall differences between treatments. For the Rotterdam Symptom Checklist, separate analyses were done for each subset (psychological well-being, physical symptoms, lung cancer symptoms, treatment symptoms, activity, and quality of life). Response rates and toxicity scores were compared by using chi2. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Patients received either r-HuEPO (150 U/kg) or placebo, subcutaneously, three times a week for 3 months. Responses were assessed by measuring changes in hemoglobin/hematocrit, transfusion requirement, and quality of life. The mean hematocrit increased by 6.0 percentage points in the r-HuEPO group versus 1.3 in the placebo group. A decrease in transfusion requirement did not reach significance over all 3 months, but there was a significant reduction in the percentage of patients transfused in the second and third months (27% r-HuEPO vs. 56% placebo) and a trend toward reduction in the mean total number of units transfused (1.20 units r-HuEPO vs. 2.02 units placebo), suggesting a lag of 1 month before r-HuEPO can affect the transfusion requirement. Pretreatment serum erythropoietin levels were lower in responders than in nonresponders (73.5 IU/L and 86.3 IU/L means, respectively).

A multi-method approach was used in which verbal instruction, written material, an audio cassette tape, and the use of a pain diary were combined to inform and instruct patients about pain and pain management. The Pain Education Program was tailored to the needs of the individual patient and consisted of three elements: (1) educating patients about the basic principles regarding pain and pain management; (2) instructing patients how to report their pain in a pain diary; and (3) instructing patients how to communicate about pain and how to contact health care providers. Following pretesting in 313 patients, patients who needed district nursing and who did not need district nursing at home were randomly assigned to a control or intervention group. Intervention group patients received the Pain Education Program in the hospital, and 3 and 7 days postdischarge by telephone; this was done by nurses who were specially trained as pain counselors. Follow-up assessments were at 2, 4 and 8 weeks postdischarge. Results of the pretest showed that many patients lacked knowledge about pain and pain management. The majority of pain topics had to be discussed. The Pain Education Program proved to be feasible: 75.0% of the patients had read the entire pain brochure, 55.7% had listened to the audio cassette, and 85.6% of pain scores were completed in the pain diary. Results showed a significant increase in pain knowledge in patients who received the Pain Education Program and a significant decrease in pain intensity.

Fifteen patients were ineligible; patient characteristics were well balanced between the two arms: 71% were male, 71% had less than 5% weight loss, 89% had a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 0 to 1, 51% had adenocarcinoma, and 61% had stage IV disease. Hematologic toxicity was significantly more severe in arm A (leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia grade 3 or 4: 66% v 19%, 83% v 55%, 36% v 2% in arms A and B, respectively), which resulted in more febrile neutropenia (27% v 3% in arms A and B, respectively), dose reductions, and treatment delays. There were a total of nine toxic deaths, six due to neutropenic sepsis: five in arm A and one in arm B. In contrast, arthralgia/myalgia (grade 2 or 3, 4% v 17%), peripheral neurotoxicity (grade 2 or 3, 6% v 29%), and hypersensitivity reactions (1% v 7%, all grades) were significantly more frequent in arm B. The frequency and severity of other toxicities were comparable between the two arms. Responses were one complete and 44 partial on arm A (28%) and two complete and 61 partial (41%) on arm B (P = .018). There was no significant difference in survival, with median and 1-year survivals 9.9 versus 9.7 months and 41% versus 43%, respectively in arm A and B. Progression-free survival was 4.9 and 5.4 months in arm A and B, respectively. Selected centers participated in a quality-of-life (QoL) assessment, which was performed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 and LC-13 administered at baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter.

The main endpoint of the trial was survival. A brief quality of life (QoL) questionnaire consisting of two multi-item scales (body image and fear of recurrence) and two single items (satisfaction with treatment and cosmetic result) was included in the trial. A cosmetic evaluation of the breast after conservative surgery was also performed. This report concentrates on the results of the QoL study and the cosmetic evaluation. Multitrait scaling analysis was employed to verify the hypothesised scale structure of the questionnaire. Treatment comparison of the QoL scores at 2 years post-treatment was performed using a stratified Wilcoxon rank sum test. Both patients' and doctors' ratings of the cosmetic result were documented on the clinical follow-up form. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify which factors influenced the cosmetic outcome. In total, 127 patients in the MRM arm and 151 in the BCT arm completed a QoL questionnaire at approximately 2 years after randomisation (months 25-36). The Cronbach's alpha coefficients were 0.79 and 0.73 for the body image and fear of recurrence scales, respectively. Significant benefit in body image and satisfaction with treatment was observed in the BCT patients. No significant difference was observed in fear of recurrence between the two groups. Ratings of cosmetic results decreased with time, in line with clinical observations of long-term side-effects of radiotherapy.

A total of 1,453 patients with either confirmed metastatic disease (M1), or T3/T4 non-metastatic disease with elevated prostate-specific antigen (M0) were recruited into one of two identical, multicentre, randomised studies to compare 'Casodex' 150 mg/day with castration. The protocols allowed for combined analysis. At a median follow-up period of approximately 100 weeks for both studies, 'Casodex' 150 mg was found to be less effective than castration in patients with metastatic disease (M1) at entry (hazard ratio of 1.30 for time to death) with a difference in median survival of 6 weeks. In symptomatic M1 patients, 'Casodex' was associated with a statistically significant improvement in subjective response (70%) compared with castration (58%). Analysis of a validated quality-of-life questionnaire proved an advantage for 'Casodex' in sexual interest and physical capacity. 'Casodex' had a substantially lower incidence of hot flushes compared to castration (6-13% compared with 39-44%) and the most commonly reported adverse events were those expected for a potent antiandrogen. However, in patients with M0 disease at entry, the data are still immature with only 13% of M0 patients having died. An initial analysis of this immature data has suggested that the results in these patients may be different to those obtained in patients with M1 disease. A further survival analysis in patients with M0 disease is therefore planned when the data are more mature. 'Casodex' 150 mg is less effective than castration in patients with M1 disease.

To test this hypothesis, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project initiated the Breast Cancer Prevention Trial (P-1) in 1992. Women (N=13388) at increased risk for breast cancer because they 1) were 60 years of age or older, 2) were 35-59 years of age with a 5-year predicted risk for breast cancer of at least 1.66%, or 3) had a history of lobular carcinoma in situ were randomly assigned to receive placebo (n=6707) or 20 mg/day tamoxifen (n=6681) for 5 years. Gail's algorithm, based on a multivariate logistic regression model using combinations of risk factors, was used to estimate the probability (risk) of occurrence of breast cancer over time. Tamoxifen reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer by 49% (two-sided P<.00001), with cumulative incidence through 69 months of follow-up of 43.4 versus 22.0 per 1000 women in the placebo and tamoxifen groups, respectively. The decreased risk occurred in women aged 49 years or younger (44%), 50-59 years (51%), and 60 years or older (55%); risk was also reduced in women with a history of lobular carcinoma in situ (56%) or atypical hyperplasia (86%) and in those with any category of predicted 5-year risk. Tamoxifen reduced the risk of noninvasive breast cancer by 50% (two-sided P<.002). Tamoxifen reduced the occurrence of estrogen receptor-positive tumors by 69%, but no difference in the occurrence of estrogen receptor-negative tumors was seen. Tamoxifen administration did not alter the average annual rate of ischemic heart disease; however, a reduction in hip, radius (Colles'), and spine fractures was observed.

In a controlled multicentre trial, patients were randomised to receive supportive care only or supportive care plus chemotherapy. Chemotherapy consisted of intravenous (i.v.) carboplatin 300 mg/m2 on day 1 and etoposide 120 mg/m2 orally on days 1-5 every 4 weeks for a maximum of eight courses. Quality of life was measured at randomisation and prior to each treatment course and at corresponding 4-week intervals in the control arm, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 + LC13 questionnaire. 48 patients were randomised (supportive care 26, chemotherapy 22), being eligible for comparative analyses. Another 102 patients, 97 of which received chemotherapy, were subsequently included in the study on an individual treatment preference basis. Data from these patients were used for confirmative purposes. Patients in the chemotherapy group reported better overall physical functioning and symptom control compared with the supportive care group. Group differences were smaller within the psychosocial domain, although trends were seen in favour of the chemotherapy group. No significant differences were seen in favour of the supportive care group, except for hair loss. Median survival times were 29 weeks in the chemotherapy group versus 11 weeks in the supportive care group, and 1-year survival rates were 28% versus 8%.

The two principal aims were: (1) to improve the survival of children with rhabdomyosarcoma; and (2) to reduce the late effects from therapy by restricting the indications for surgery and/or radiotherapy after good response to initial chemotherapy. A further aim was to investigate the role of high-dose chemotherapy in young patients with parameningeal primary tumours. 186 previously untreated eligible patients entered the study. Patients with completely resected primary tumour received three courses of IVA (ifosfamide, vincristine and actinomycin D). Patients with incompletely resected tumour received six to 10 courses of IVA according to stage. Patients achieving complete remission with chemotherapy alone did not usually receive radiotherapy or undergo extensive surgery, but patients remaining in partial remission received local therapy with surgery and/or radiotherapy. Only patients over 5 years of age with parameningeal disease and patients over 12 years with tumours at any site were given systematic irradiation. Complete remission was achieved in 91% (170/186) of all patients. With a median follow-up of 8 years, the 5-year overall survival was 68% (+/- 3% standard error of the mean (SEM) and the 5-year event-free survival 53% (+/- 4% SEM). These results show an improvement over previous SIOP study (RMS75) in which survival was 52% and event-free survival was 47%. Among the 54 patients who exhibited isolated local relapse, 35% (19/54) survived in further remission longer than 2 years after retreatment, including local therapy (surgery +/- radiotherapy). Analysis of the overall burden of therapy received by all surviving children (including primary treatment and treatment for relapse if required) showed that 24% (28/116) were treated by limited surgery followed by three courses of IVA, 29% (34/116) were treated by chemotherapy alone (after initial biopsy) and 13% (15/116) received chemotherapy plus conservative local treatment (limited surgery or radiotherapy for residual disease). Only 34% (39/116) received intensive local therapy defined as radical wide field radiotherapy or radical surgery or both. Compared with the results obtained in the previous SIOP study, treatment in MMT84 was based on response to initial chemotherapy and, despite an overall reduction of the use of local therapy, significantly improved survival for patients with non-metastatic disease.

We explored the quality of life (QoL) of such patients in a multicenter randomized trial that compared vinorelbine treatment with supportive care alone. Eligible patients were 70 years of age or older, had stage IV or IIIB NSCLC that was ineligible for radiotherapy, and had a performance status of 0-2 (a status of fully active to a status of capable of all self-care but unable to work). Vinorelbine was given intravenously on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day treatment cycle, for a total of six cycles. QoL was evaluated with European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaires QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13, and the QoL data were analyzed by fitting a linear mixed model for each QoL scale. Survival curves were plotted and were compared with the Mantel-Haenszel test. Relative hazards of death and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by the Cox model. Investigators, blinded to the results, stopped the trial early because of a low enrollment rate. (From April 1996 to November 1997, 191 of the 350 targeted patients were randomly assigned.) Data from 161 patients have been analyzed.
