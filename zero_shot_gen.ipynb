We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "[FULL TEXT]: TITLE: So I have more guns than I'd like to admit, but I feel like a lot of people shouldn't own guns. POST: The drunk guy I agree with, however the other two are perfectly fine. Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young. Too bad other parents believed the same thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

      "[FULL TEXT]: TITLE: So I have more guns than I'd like to admit, but I feel like a lot of people shouldn't own guns. POST: The drunk guy I agree with, however the other two are perfectly fine. Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young. Too bad other parents believed the same thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

I think back to former President Obama who was not one who was for same sex marriage.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

      "[FULL TEXT]: TITLE: Tennessee Senator calls higher education a'liberal breeding ground,' calls to remove it all together POST: So he's saying liberals are better educated than conservatives. We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.

Olive oil is healthy even though it has calories and fruit is healthy even though it has carbs. Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands. You don't need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy. Also people need to learn the difference between added sugar and natural sugar. The sugar in fruit is not the same sugar in candy bars. I think one of the biggest reasons for the obesity epidemic in America is the over-complication of nutrition.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.

POST: Incoming comments of things that are nutritious but people don't consider healthy because they're high in calories AND other random shit they read on a blog who's ultimate goal is to convince them to spend money on something at some point. Olive oil is healthy even though it has calories and fruit is healthy even though it has carbs. Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands. You don't need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy. Also people need to learn the difference between added sugar and natural sugar. The sugar in fruit is not the same sugar in candy bars. I think one of the biggest reasons for the obesity epidemic in America is the over-complication of nutrition.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

If you give the government *any* control over what is considered\"hate speech\", you are basically relinquishing your freedom of speech. It's a slippery slope. For example: saying\"hateful\" things about Islam becomes illegal. Let's say you criticise Sharia laws (laws based off of the rules set out in Islam for those who are unaware). Next thing you know, your own government has full power to censor this\"hate\", and you are persecuted simply for disagreeing with the laws of an ally nation.

North korea is still waiting on the Kim dynasty to die off, Spain had to wait until Franco dies to start modernizing, the people of Congo had to wait until Leo II died so they can stop getting killed, and the catholic world had to wait until John XII to normalize again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval.

No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

If you give the government *any* control over what is considered\"hate speech\", you are basically relinquishing your freedom of speech. It's a slippery slope. For example: saying\"hateful\" things about Islam becomes illegal. Let's say you criticise Sharia laws (laws based off of the rules set out in Islam for those who are unaware). Next thing you know, your own government has full power to censor this\"hate\", and you are persecuted simply for disagreeing with the laws of an ally nation.

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

If you give the government *any* control over what is considered\"hate speech\", you are basically relinquishing your freedom of speech. It's a slippery slope. For example: saying\"hateful\" things about Islam becomes illegal. Let's say you criticise Sharia laws (laws based off of the rules set out in Islam for those who are unaware). Next thing you know, your own government has full power to censor this\"hate\", and you are persecuted simply for disagreeing with the laws of an ally nation.

Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

Democracy cannot survive if China is the global power.\" POST: Well, democracy gave us Trump to the whole world. I'll let others judge what democracy is. POST: Lets see what other system gave us. Communism gave us the Kim dynasty that destroyed their own country. Fascism gave us Franco that kept his country decades in the past in every manner. Monarchism gave us Leopold II of Belgium who committed genocides in Africa Theocracy gave us Pope John XII who fucked half of rome So as we can easily gather, every for of government had its share of shitty figureheads. That doesnt prove anything. At least in democracy we have the chance to switch them, you know what they do in other forms of government? Wait. North korea is still waiting on the Kim dynasty to die off, Spain had to wait until Franco dies to start modernizing, the people of Congo had to wait until Leo II died so they can stop getting killed, and the catholic world had to wait until John XII to normalize again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Communism gave us the Kim dynasty that destroyed their own country. Fascism gave us Franco that kept his country decades in the past in every manner. Monarchism gave us Leopold II of Belgium who committed genocides in Africa Theocracy gave us Pope John XII who fucked half of rome So as we can easily gather, every for of government had its share of shitty figureheads. That doesnt prove anything. At least in democracy we have the chance to switch them, you know what they do in other forms of government? Wait. North korea is still waiting on the Kim dynasty to die off, Spain had to wait until Franco dies to start modernizing, the people of Congo had to wait until Leo II died so they can stop getting killed, and the catholic world had to wait until John XII to normalize again.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

      "[FULL TEXT]: When it comes to national security, I am glad that crimes like these are taken seriously and agree with you completely! It makes me think of criminologist, Mr. Hank Astom, once said about a suspect's innocence -  that innocent people are hardly ever innocent if they are shouting it from the start. Due process has to take place to ensure the truth is found. I believe Mr. Astom is spot on, we should support our legal system in it's investigation. When considering guilty or innocence, we  had to consider what Mr. Astom said about smokescreens, right? I would love to agree with you, but you basing your whole argument on this supposed criminologist is giving me major pause. Who is this Mr. Hank Astom? What makes him such an expert in criminology?

      "[FULL TEXT]: TITLE: So I have more guns than I'd like to admit, but I feel like a lot of people shouldn't own guns. POST: The drunk guy I agree with, however the other two are perfectly fine. Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young. Too bad other parents believed the same thing.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",
