Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

      "[FULL TEXT]: TITLE: Tennessee Senator calls higher education a'liberal breeding ground,' calls to remove it all together POST: So he's saying liberals are better educated than conservatives. We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old.

Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes.

But first we need to unite in stomping out this virus, because the virus doesn't care if you're Afghani, Czech or Martian! It is certainly possible to worry about 2 issues at the same time. The pandemic has created serious problems that we have to address. Stereotypes, however, can also be just as damaging as a virus to people. I think it is admirable that someone produced a film that can challenge the negative beliefs some have about Afghanistan.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

The women of Indonesia are gravely concerned with the situation in Iran, they are worried that this could be their future as well. We should be embracing and supporting the efforts they are giving in their protests, what they are doing shines a light on a dark situation ongoing in Iran. It doesn't matter what the majority thinks when it is hurting others, I think that is obvious to everyone.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

It broke my heart. And he was flippant and dismissive. The Eucharist is not a reward or something you deserve if you are obstinate to church teachings POST: There are valid reasons to be both Catholic and support legalized abortion. Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not. Nations with no legal abortions have higher rates of unsafe abortions, maternal death, and female teen suicide. We must care about the health and life of women too. These women are at their lowest and need compassion and safety. If restricting and banning abortion doesn't lower the rates of abortions, but instead causes more harm and death, it is not a good policy. <URL> Choosing compassion over virtue signaling should not place any individual in mortal sin. After all, 51% of US Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. <URL><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.

The Eucharist is not a reward or something you deserve if you are obstinate to church teachings POST: There are valid reasons to be both Catholic and support legalized abortion. Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not. Nations with no legal abortions have higher rates of unsafe abortions, maternal death, and female teen suicide. We must care about the health and life of women too. These women are at their lowest and need compassion and safety. If restricting and banning abortion doesn't lower the rates of abortions, but instead causes more harm and death, it is not a good policy. <URL> Choosing compassion over virtue signaling should not place any individual in mortal sin.

The Eucharist is not a reward or something you deserve if you are obstinate to church teachings POST: There are valid reasons to be both Catholic and support legalized abortion. Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not. Nations with no legal abortions have higher rates of unsafe abortions, maternal death, and female teen suicide. We must care about the health and life of women too. These women are at their lowest and need compassion and safety. If restricting and banning abortion doesn't lower the rates of abortions, but instead causes more harm and death, it is not a good policy. <URL> Choosing compassion over virtue signaling should not place any individual in mortal sin.

Are there just only two options - gritting teeth and bearing through or causing a full-blown revolt with potentially serious consequences? But, surely these aren't the only options during such a crisis. There must be other ways to navigate such difficult times. It's easy to feel trapped between gritting teeth and causing a revolt, but perhaps the real challenge is charting a different, more sustainable path through adversity. After all, aren't human beings capable of innovation and adaptability? If the majority of the people accept the lockdown, maybe it is the best solution. The power of the people can often give a good result. The government often does the will of the people and maybe this solution is the best option.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

Balance can't include any refined sugar at all because we weren't able to process it. Before the food pyramid came around the upper end of sugar consumption would have been much lower.

Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned.

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

I am wondering if all civilians should think of issuing very strong statements as well, because maybe they will start blocking individuals next!

      "[FULL TEXT]: TITLE: Don't forget to offer acts of reparation for the frequent acts of desecration/sacrilege against the Eucharist POST: I got into a discussion with someone on here who claimed that even though he supported legalized abortion and was pro choice he still received. It broke my heart. And he was flippant and dismissive. The Eucharist is not a reward or something you deserve if you are obstinate to church teachings POST: There are valid reasons to be both Catholic and support legalized abortion. Studies show that abortions occur just as frequently in nations where it is legal as nations where it is not. Nations with no legal abortions have higher rates of unsafe abortions, maternal death, and female teen suicide. We must care about the health and life of women too. These women are at their lowest and need compassion and safety. If restricting and banning abortion doesn't lower the rates of abortions, but instead causes more harm and death, it is not a good policy. <URL> Choosing compassion over virtue signaling should not place any individual in mortal sin. After all, 51% of US Catholics believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. <URL><|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",

We agree. Trump isn't the only one who loves the poorly educated. POST: Or, more accurately, many liberal professors abuse their positions by attempting to force their political opinions into subjects they don't belong in, like the English professor who insists their students each write a paper on\"Why the GOP are terrorists\" and grade students poorly who disagree with that opinion (experienced that first hand). Many of the big name institutions have become incestuous single minded orgies which no longer challenge students to think out of the box, challenge assumed truths and seek to learn all they can, but instead have become factories to produce a very specific set of opinions and mindsets never to be questioned. This isn't a call to abolish higher learning, but I think the entire system needs to be reassessed, not only due to outrageous costs and access issues.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n",
