So, I agree with everyone that it is concerning how the trust the public has in the government is threatened. While this lack of trust is alarming, let's not overlook the larger issues that plague society as a whole. We live in a time where climate change is drastically changing the landscape of how we live. There are also issues with homelessness and wealth inequality. Sure, misinformation and not trusting the government is bad, but in the grand scheme of things but we need to figure out how to solve those issues while our government continues to fail the people!

POST: Incoming comments of things that are nutritious but people don\'t consider healthy because they\'re high in calories AND other random shit they read on a blog who\'s ultimate goal is to convince them to spend money on something at some point. Olive oil is healthy even though it has calories and fruit is healthy even though it has carbs. Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands. You don\'t need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy. Also people need to learn the difference between added sugar and natural sugar. The sugar in fruit is not the same sugar in candy bars. I think one of the biggest reasons for the obesity epidemic in America is the over-complication of nutrition.

POST: The drunk guy I agree with, however the other two are perfectly fine. Most states have laws against carry while drinking. Someone choosing to open carry an AR isnt subject to your approval. They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young. Too bad other parents believed the same thing.\n\n""}]",['appeal to ridicule']

Olive oil is healthy even though it has calories and fruit is healthy even though it has carbs. Dairy and red meat are fine - people have been consuming them for centuries and they did shit like building pyramids using just their hands. You don\'t need to live off of bland chicken breasts, broccoli, and scrambled eggs to be healthy. Also people need to learn the difference between added sugar and natural sugar. The sugar in fruit is not the same sugar in candy bars. I think one of the biggest reasons for the obesity epidemic in America is the over-complication of nutrition.

They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.
