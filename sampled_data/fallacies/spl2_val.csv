Although the Pope has come out and apologized for the mistreatment of indigenous people on behalf of the Catholic church, we need to stop letting people like him determine how we live our lives.\n[FULL TEXT]: I'm curious, do the statistics actually show persistent racism against indigenous peoples? I mean, disparities don't necessarily mean people are being treated differently. Of course, it can mean that, and I wouldn't be surprised if it did, but I'd be interested to delve deeper. I would very much appreciate some studies or research, if anyone can share. There is no deeper dive needed in order to see the injustices indigenous people have faced throughout history and are still facing today. These evangelical leaders in Guatemala are sure behaving as far away from Christlike as they can. We need to stop letting these religious leaders get away with their ignorant and bigoted behaviors in the name of religion. These fanatics need to be treated as the criminals that they are. You don't hold people captive and abuse them. These people are using religion as a weapon to bring pain upon the indigenous people. Although the Pope has come out and apologized for the mistreatment of indigenous people on behalf of the Catholic church, we need to stop letting people like him determine how we live our lives.\n""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '<|ANSWER|>appeal to authority<|ANSWER|>.'}]",['appeal to authority']

They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old.

Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.

They dont need you to think their are cool to exercise a right. 14 year olds are plenty old enough to be around loaded guns. They arent 4. I had guns in a safe in my bedroom from 10 years old. I had the key and ammo. Again, someone else's rights arent based on your approval. POST: Yeah its not just about my approval, pretty sure the majority of people in the U.S are against open carrying an AR. No one sees someone carrying a long gun in public and thinks wow look at them go, so glad they are exercising their rights. Theyre thinking Im glad I have my ccw so I can drop this motherfucker if he sneezes. And youre right, I should just assume that all 14 year olds were taught properly on how to handle firearms even if their parents are pieces of shit. I shouldnt care if he hurts himself or someone else because if I did Id just be infringing in someones rights. Glad your parents believed you wouldnt kill someone with a gun that young.
