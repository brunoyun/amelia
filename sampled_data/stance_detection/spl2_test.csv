And study after study continues to affirm that the best environment for a child to be raised is with a married father and mother living under the same roof. Government schools and the entertainment media have done a powerful job of teaching moral relativism ad nauseam, while avoiding the teaching of real science and biology on this matter. And with no rigorous critical thinking taught in public schools, it's not surprising that the younger generation is confused about sexual absolutes and numb to societal consequences.

Despite what is heard from radicals and extremists about God's wrath, the majority of world consensus that has any understanding of the word 'God' from the Christian sense is that God is commonly good and supports that which is for the common good of society.
