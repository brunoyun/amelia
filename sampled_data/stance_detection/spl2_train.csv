There are already many benefits afforded to homosexuals (domestic partnership benefits, they're allowed to enter into contracts, etc.).

The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo.

This is shown by the low proportion of gay marriages performed and children raised in countries where gay marriage has been legal for some time.   It is not an accident that marriage has been between men and women for all of human history. Gay marriage advocates are not original in their beliefs.

And neither will straight couples who don't WANT children but CAN. What is the point of this argument when these straight couples won't be producing any children? Are we going to value people by what they CAN do? In that case, why not get rid of and kill all the disabled, the elderly, terminally ill patients, the mentally ill, the homeless, and everybody and anyone who can't be a potential benefit to society?  Also to be quite frank, in general, taxpayers don't want to be taxpayers. Many people don't have children and these people believe that it is wrong for them to be paying taxes for education.
