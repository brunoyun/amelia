How can you claim credit for the present administration for more new water project starts than any other time in our history , when the stated Republican position except in campaign election years has been a no-new-starts policy that the Democratic Congress has sought to overcome ? 5. How can you call the vetoed 1960 Democratic bill on depressed areas  straight pork barrel  when your own Secretary of Labor , just 24 hours before the veto was announced , called the bill  good enough so that any Senator or Congressman from a State with areas of chronic unemployment would have no alternative but vote for it  ? 6. Why do you take credit for the present levels of operations at the National Institutes of Health , when the Democratic Congress , ignoring threats of veto , raised the administration request from $ 400 million to $ 560 million for the present year - the sixth consecutive year that Democrats have raised administration requests ? 7.

Rather the road to a world at peace runs through a revitalized and growing American economy , through the arduous construction of defenses so powerful that the Communists know that peace is their only alternative , through vast research projects to solve the complex difficulties of controlling modern arms , through carefully prepared disarmament programs to be presented by skilled and experienced negotiators , and through the exercise of a firm Presidential leadership which will never allow either our own representatives or the rest of the world to wonder what our position is , to wonder indeed , if we have any position at all , or to doubt the sincerity of our desire for disarmament . Words alone will never impress Mr. Khrushchev .\n[TARGET]: So , anytime we make a disarmament agreement which does not have inspection , under which they might increase their strength as against ours , it increases the risk of war . That 's why I say that we stand for peace when we say , as President Eisenhower says : Yes , we will go to Geneva and discuss disarmament and stopping tests ; yes , we will go to the summit and discuss disarmament and stopping tests .

Why do you repeat the statement that real wages have gone up 15 percent during the present administration compared with only 2 percent in the previous one , when your own Department of Labor figures clearly establish that the increase between September 1945 ( the first postwar month ) and January 1953 was 18.3 percent while the increase between January 1953 and August 1960 has been 13.7 percent . 2. Why have you not personally admitted that you misquoted me when you said that in my Detroit speech on Labor Day I had said  What the American labor movement wants for America is what I want for America  when this statement did not appear in either my advance statement or in the speech as actually delivered ? 3. When you insist that Federal aid to teachers salaries means Federal control over education , are you aware of the fact that the present program for aid to federally impacted areas has been free of such control , and that the provision which you killed with your tie-breaking vote contained explicit language ruling out any Federal  direction , supervision , or control over the policy determinations , personnel , program of instruction , or the administration or operation of any school or school system  ? 4. How can you claim credit for the present administration for more new water project starts than any other time in our history , when the stated Republican position except in campaign election years has been a no-new-starts policy that the Democratic Congress has sought to overcome ? 5. How can you call the vetoed 1960 Democratic bill on depressed areas  straight pork barrel  when your own Secretary of Labor , just 24 hours before the veto was announced , called the bill  good enough so that any Senator or Congressman from a State with areas of chronic unemployment would have no alternative but vote for it  ? 6. Why do you take credit for the present levels of operations at the National Institutes of Health , when the Democratic Congress , ignoring threats of veto , raised the administration request from $ 400 million to $ 560 million for the present year - the sixth consecutive year that Democrats have raised administration requests ? 7. On October 5 , in Philadelphia , you talked about civil rights and said ,  My position and that of my running mate has been clear and straightforward .

In fact, it is their sexual orientation that ultimately prevents their desire to participate in traditional marriage (not some law or form of discrimination toward homosexuals). There are actually many self proclaimed homosexuals who do currently engage in traditional marriage (and raise families, etc.) This is proof that homosexuals are not restricted from marriage (as defined between man and woman) I truly believe that the powers behind the cause to re-define marriage stem from a stronger desire to attack a religious institution that does not support homosexuality, rather than a desire to achieve the same benefits as marriage for same sex couples.
