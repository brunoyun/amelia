Also, if you are going to take the Christian path, The Bible never mentions that Jesus condemned homosexuality, and said that all the laws hang on two principles, love your god, and love your neighbor, and every law for Christians must follow one of these.

In a time when many countries are facing below-replacement birth rates, we should be encouraging marriage, not dividing and weakening it.  Gay marriage advocates use emotional rhetoric to bypass the fact that children raised by gays are more likely to be gay themselves. Common sense demands it, and studies prove it. Sexuality is in large part a learned trait, and can be influenced over time just like someone's weight. Furthermore, the (primarily atheist) forces behind gay marriage seek to end marriage completely, since they see it as a religious ideology. This is shown by the low proportion of gay marriages performed and children raised in countries where gay marriage has been legal for some time.   It is not an accident that marriage has been between men and women for all of human history. Gay marriage advocates are not original in their beliefs. Other societies have tried to change marriage to suit their beliefs, and they have either stagnated or failed.

Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.  The slippery slope arguments is one of the oldest chestnuts to cause confusion and install fear and doubt.  The cited outcomes of same-sex marriage border on preposterous and inflammatory.  No reasonable person could possibly follow the inane blathering.  Finally, going back to the earliest extant Hebrew Torah, I am absolutely unable to find any text in which God says to Adam and Eve, Okay, first you guys get married and then you be fruitful and multiply.
