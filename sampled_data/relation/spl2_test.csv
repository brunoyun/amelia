Now , in the case of medical care for the aged , as I said in my statement , being tied to social security , which I thought was extremely important , as you know in the Senate we secured the support of only one Republican , and we were informed by the minority leader , Mr. Dirksen , when the matter came to a vote , that if we passed social security , it would be vetoed by the President . In the case of the $ 1.25 minimum wage , which was my bill , which we did pass in the Senate by a vote of 2 to 1 , we failed in the conference with the House , after Mr. Dirksen , the minority leader , announced that the President of the United States would veto any bill that had $ 1.25 minimum wage .\n""}]",['no relation']

In addition , too many of the aged and aging : face discrimination in eniployment because of age ; have unsuitable , often unbearable , housing conditions ; have little recreation , too often resulting in isolation and mental disturbance .\n[TARGET]: I feel very strongly on this . As a matter of fact , I introduced one of the first bills providing that all of our older people and others would be able to obtain medical care insurance when I was a Congressman back in the year 1948 .

If you have unemployment here , it is not only citizens who want a job who ca n't find work ; there are some of the most highly skilled people in the United States whose skills as a team and as individuals could be dissipated . Therefore , I think the United States should make a greater effort in the field of missiles , first ; secondly , it should do a greater job and a better job in the field of developing an airlift capacity - nearly all the planes that took the U.N. forces to the Congo were American planes , but most of them were planes which are becoming obsolete and they contrasted in some cases to the jets which the Russians and the British used for transportation of U.N. personnel - and thirdly , I think that we should strengthen our retaliatory capacity , the traditional manned bomber , unless the United States is prepared to give up the lead in this vital form of national defense and national security .\n[TARGET]: And in both 1958 and 1959 , an average of more than 1 million idle workers remained out of a job for more than 15 weeks - the highest number since before the war . These figures tell a human story - the story of unemployment benefits running out - of 3 million Americans forced to live on an unhealthy tasteless diet of surplus foods - a story of hardship and personal tragedy . What , then , does Mr. Nixon mean when he says we are enjoying the greatest prosperity that Americans have ever enjoyed ? Perhaps he believes that if only 1 out of every 10 Americans are unable to find full-time work , the other 9 out of every 10 must be doing all right .\n""}]",['no relation']

There are those who say ,  Why do n't we send Marines to Cuba ?  We could do it and we could give it to Mr. Castro in 24 hours , but getting rid of Castro in Cuba would not get rid of Castroism in Cuba or in Latin America and it would set in motion , in my opinion , a chain reaction of opposition to the United States through the other Latin American countries , which could be very , very detrimental to our foreign policy . That 's why I think the United States , with its great power , has to continue to treat Cuba , as it has , with consideration , always patient , working with our other friends in Latin America , to be sure that they will support our position toward Castro and toward his close association with communism in Cuba .

Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.  The slippery slope arguments is one of the oldest chestnuts to cause confusion and install fear and doubt.  The cited outcomes of same-sex marriage border on preposterous and inflammatory.  No reasonable person could possibly follow the inane blathering.  Finally, going back to the earliest extant Hebrew Torah, I am absolutely unable to find any text in which God says to Adam and Eve, Okay, first you guys get married and then you be fruitful and multiply.

My mom 'turned lesbian' about two years after my parents divorced. I was about 15 years old. Since she wanted to live up to her selfish ways of being a 'guy trapped in a woman's body' I had no one to guide me through my teenage years of being a girl. I had to figure everything out on my own and aside from that, live with the fear of people finding out who my mom was. The few people that did find out began bullying me.

This country needs to realize that if we deny one class of citizens their rights, we ourselves can never, ever use our constitution as a valid argument, as we've already crossed it.  Since people often seem to bring religion into the picture, may I remind you of the separation of church and state. You can't bring someone's religious opinion into an issue like this.

Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic.

Love has never been a factor. Marriage is divided among gender lines, not love lines, because only men and women can reproduce. In a time when many countries are facing below-replacement birth rates, we should be encouraging marriage, not dividing and weakening it.  Gay marriage advocates use emotional rhetoric to bypass the fact that children raised by gays are more likely to be gay themselves. Common sense demands it, and studies prove it. Sexuality is in large part a learned trait, and can be influenced over time just like someone's weight. Furthermore, the (primarily atheist) forces behind gay marriage seek to end marriage completely, since they see it as a religious ideology. This is shown by the low proportion of gay marriages performed and children raised in countries where gay marriage has been legal for some time.   It is not an accident that marriage has been between men and women for all of human history. Gay marriage advocates are not original in their beliefs. Other societies have tried to change marriage to suit their beliefs, and they have either stagnated or failed.

The marriage union is the beginning to creation of a family, and without that essential possibility of the creation of children there is no reason for marriage.  I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.
