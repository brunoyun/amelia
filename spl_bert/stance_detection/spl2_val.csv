comarg,sample,For,"Absollutely, gay marriage should be allowed. The contingency that some view marriage is religous values, however in the US we are guanranteed religous freedom under the constition, who is to say what each US citizens beleif in these values are? I also beleive when 2 people committ to each other in love  matrimony  deticate their lives to each other-who has a moral right to object? Lovedevotion should not be interferred with. Laws are to protect people not to constrain choices that cause no harm. No matter what an individuals beleifs are laws should not forbade the freedom of choice. Besides who is to say God would prevent love? God is love. As for those who say marriage is about procreation-what about those who cant have children, should they not be allowed to marry? God is w/in a person, the church may not be caught up w/Gods love,or caught up w/Gods love for all? There is no impirical evidence that gay marriages would cause divorce w/hetrosexuals-they been getting divorce for multiple years on their own. And what I dont get is why would a person care-or prevent those that want to married no matter the sex want to stop freedom of choice, whether by laws or by discrimination?",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"No where in the United States Constitution is there any restriction on who should and shouldn't marry; the sanctity of marriage, according to the Constitution, is not defined as a union between a man and a woman. All definitions of sanctity of marriage is based off of religious beliefs, not governmental precautions. Love is still the same when between a same-sex couple. Gays and lesbians are still citizens, have friends and families, some attend chuch and lead lives that heterosexuals would lead. What seperates a gay or lesbian from the rest of society when they do the same exact things as us, and the only difference may be their choice of life partners? Who are we to determine what's best for others? We don't know every single same-sex couple, their pasts or life stories, who are we to determine their fate? Gay people worship Jesus, and if he hadn't of wanted anyone to like people of the same sex, then he would of made them differently. Let people determine how they spend their lives in the afterlife. We lead our own lives, let gays and lesbians lead their own. Their not hurting us, we shouldn't hurt them. Whatever you believe is your business; don't force it down anyone elses throats. Worry about yourself; leave others be.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"Yes. Our country was established upon Christianity. If not for the religion our country would not be. Remember the manifest destiny. God helped our country spread from the Atlantic ocean to the Pacific ocean. Of course people from other countries with other religions would not want our country to be under God, they're not Americans. Also, under god does not highlight only Christianity. Muslims address their god by saying god as well as Jews, some other religions.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"Yes, Under god should certainly be in the Pledge. This was a christian nation when we started. Most people misinterpret the phrase freedom of religion. Back then there was only one religion and that was christian so freedom of christian religion to be catholic baptist etc...  Think people It is mandatory.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"The Con side has very weak arguments 1.  The argument that churches will be forced to do anything is absolutely false.   Many churches support marriage equality.   2.  Outdated and off-point references:  The Supreme Ct decision in 1971 is outdated and misapplied, as it was only a summary dismissal;  the reference [Child Dev. 203 73(3)] on sexual activity of girls who are raised without fathers is misapplied -- it doesn't anything about two parent gay families.  Using the misapplied logic:  two gay men raising daughters would be ideal to delay sexual activity of teenage girls! 3.  Con point 3 about divorce is directly contradicted by data. 4.  The slippery slope scare ignores the real harms that come from polygamy, etc.  There are no real harms in extending equality for two consenting adults.   5.  Most ridiculous argument: con point 5 - People should not have their tax dollars used to support something they find wrong, oh like false-premise preemptive war?",['For']

comarg,sample,For,"GAY MARRIAGE DOES NOTHING TO HARM ANYONE, AND IT IS DISCRIMINATION AGAINST THEM IF WE DON'T ALLOW THEM TO BE MARRIED!!!!!! STOP SAME-SEX MARRIAGE DISCRIMINATION!!!",['For']
comarg,sample,For,There isnt anything wrong with being gay it isnt a choice its what you truly are noyone will force anyone to be gay. Most of the time people become gay due to rape or bullying which is something that needs to stop bullying is a big controversial issue in this state. Same sex marriage should be legalized everyone has the right to marry who they love. For example if u were straight and you could never marry your lover wouldnt that bother you too you would do the exactly same thing the other gay protestants are doing. If gay mariages are legal all over the world there will always be love and peace too go around maybe less crime all gays are trying to show you can marry anyone you love man or woman. This might interfere with the constitutional rights but the constitution does say that all the people have rights and liberty. Which means that same sex marriage can be legal and should be due to the process of law. Gay marriages will be legal it will make a change in this world its just the peoples choice to accept this change.,['For']
comarg,sample,For,Marriage is a Civil Contract ergo not a matter for Religious interpretation.  Matrimony is the name given by Religion to Marriage as Sacrament and each Religion has a right to define its nature within the structure of said Religion or Church.  I am of the opinion that any Church or Church related organization which affects the outcome of a Civil Matter needs to be treated by the Judicial System as a breach of their Tax Free status and a violation of the separation of  Church and State.  The Civil matters and Institutions of this Country cannot be ruled by any Taliban of whatever Religious inclination. We are still teaching children in school that it was in search of Religious Freedom that this Country was founded and setteled.,['For']
comarg,sample,For,Majority supports the phrase as do I.,['For']
comarg,sample,For,"The arguments put forward by the CON side of this debate are almost entirely based on religious and/or logically shaky foundations. Specifically the idea that allowing gay marriage would further weaken an already weakened institution. This notion is absurd, as allowing more people who love each other to marry each other surely would only strengthen the institution of marriage rather than detract from it.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"I'm quite on the line on this issue... I'm atheist, I'll admit that. But... I guess it comes down to this. The concept of God has been massively important in our nation's history. A lot of historical events would not have happened without religion fueling them. So, why not? Atheist or not, under God is a vital piece of the Pledge of Allegiance.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,I am whole hardly in favor of having Under God in the Pledge of Allegiance. We are a Christian nation founded on Biblical values since our inception. We must remain a Christian nation always and never stand devided as what is happening lately. We must value our Christian heritage and teach them to our children and grandchildren. The Aithiests have thier opinion but they are completely wrong in their way of thinking and they can`t change the fact that we were founded with Biblical values in the forefront by our founding father`s and they can`t change that no matter what they say. Thier opinion is flawed and they need the prayers of the Christian community so they can have a change of heart and let the light of Jesus to shine in their hearts and not oppose our Christian values and heritage and unite with us in a common cause to save the moral values of our nation or our nation will be lost to immorality and perversion with no sense of right and wrong.,['For']

comarg,sample,Against,"In this physical world, which consists of polarity: up-down, positive-negative, left brain-right brain, colors and their complement (ex: black-white, violet-yellow,etc); polarity rules all. The soul of man (created by the creator), invisible to normal human vision because it is comprised of more subtle substance than human flesh, is contacted by the human mother who becomes a conduit, or who touches that (soul) realm (now we know why sex is sacred and so we may understand why some scriptures prescribe severe penalties for RAPE - the victim's soul is interfered with, thereby). Two same-sex people cannot do that ON THEIR OWN. Fertilized egg implants or any type of engineering does not alter the fact that the Mercy of The Creator is NOT extended to them in that regard, nor can they have that type of access.   Now, don't get me wrong.  This is not hate; simply facts as I see them. Therefore it is best to let them continue in their folly, BUT,  they are not to indoctrinate others, especially our children, nor are they to be granted any special rights. They already have the constitution. Let us be careful. Could THIS be a plot to make it  EASIER to conquer mankind by causing us to descend to ungodly considerations and principles?",['Against']
comarg,sample,Against,"Thank you God   Gays say it is the same, let's examine that statement. Man + women = man and women ok man + man + man and man not the same. Woman + woman + woman and woman not the same. Why do gay people always flaunt their gayness they want you to believe that they are a race, ethnic group which they are neither. The want the right to destroy other people's children with their doctrine. The gays want  gay doctrine taught in schools. Why do school age children need to be worried about such perversion.  Innocent children only see the truth and will speak on it now the gay left is pushing the BULLYING agenda, because they do not want to hear that they are wrong. Gay people always want to tell the world I'm gay, why. Hetrosexuals don't go around saying I'm straight all day  Gay people say it is the 21st century well what was wrong in the 1st century is still wrong today. If we were all gay we would not be reproducing. So it would only end in the death of mankind. Gays have only hurt our country with divisions.

comarg,sample,Against,"NO. What if someone in school is part of a religion that doesn't believe in god? What if the teachers force them to say it? Even ENCOURAGING it in a public school, is by definition, against the law, as you aren't allowed to **preach** religion in public schools!",['Against']

Animal rights activist will probably say your discriminating by not letting him marry. Hey how is he different? He's just as loving as anybody else? He should get the same rights as everyone else. Love is love and he was born that way, so don't be so hateful qouting your Bible saying why it's wrong. So what, he and his monkey can't have kids theyre just as loving and can raise kids like anyone else... Anyone get my drift? Does this argument sound familiar?
