comarg,sample,For,"The fact is religious beliefs are not a valid source for making law. When the Founders wrote the nation's Constitution, they specified that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States. (Article 6, section 3) This provision was radical in its day-- giving equal citizenship to believers and non-believers alike. They wanted to ensure that no religion could make the claim of being the official, national religion, such as England had.  No individual or congregation will have to give up their beliefs by allow homosexuals to marry. If a church does not want to marry homosexuals then they NEVER have to. Having separate terms, marriage for heterosexuals and civil unions for homosexuals will only open the door for segregation on paper. Examples would be gays paying more in tax or health insurance policies, approval or denial of access to partners benefits like SS, disability. Separate is NOT equal!",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"Since it is a governmental thing, then no.  I'm OK with it being there, though.  It's a bit of a trivial matter.  Where does NBC get of censoring what was supposed to be a newscast?",['For']
comarg,sample,For,I am atheist myself yet think under god should stay in our Pledge of Allegiance because if it wasn't for God the United States might not exist. Because of protestant religions the United States exists today,['For']

comarg,sample,For,"It was God who brought forth the nation and will preserve us a nation. If our coins, dollar bills, and license plates say under God, our pledge of allegiance should too.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"I believe in the US Constitution.  All persons in the US are granted civil rights, regardless of sex, age, gender, color, and other federal laws. That's what the US Constitution grants ALL persons and not just for heterosexual persons. Everyone talks about gays being a group; well, heterosexuals are also a group.  I truly believe that everyone should let everyone else do what they believe in and feel they should do and not impose upon ALL persons their rights or beliefs!  I am a Cuban-American, having lived here since I was 4 years old, raised Catholic, yet I am gay/lesbian.  As a gay/lesbian person, I believe in God as most Americans do.  Again, people should be left to do as they feel and love whomever they chose to do, regardless of whether they are straight, gay, or otherwise.  The sooner everyone, including the politicians, understand that they are violating the US Constitution, the sooner this country can move into a 21st Century.  Gay marriage is not the end of marriage, but it is the beginning of new ideas and open minds while still preserving a union of two people who love each other and want to be together.  Two people in love should be allowed to marry, regardless of their sexual preference.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"In answer to It is wrong to create fatherless or motherless families by design. Same-sex marriages have more to do with the desires of adults than the needs of children. Human experience and a vast body of social science research show that children do best in married, mother-father households..Bologna!!There is no solid evidence saying that gay couples put children in an unstable environment children need love and acceptance it doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is if you are capable of being responsible and compassionate- there are many good married Christian parents who abuse and shame their children- Children need positive role models not intolerance and a morality that picks and chooses what's right and wrong, and translates the bible to suit their own agenda.As for Ann Landers comment that gay marriage 'flies in the face of cultural and traditional family life as we have known it for centuries. And that's where I must draw the line. Sorry.- Obviously the first few thousand years of existence when people lived without marriage and in poly-amorous extended families, with different spiritual beliefs is not a part of history she cares to learn about Christianity was not the first religion and God is way too big to fit into such a limited un-inclusive belief system",['For']
comarg,sample,For,Yes because our country is pretty much based on religion. A lot of our wars were fought because of religion. So why would we protect it so much to not have it in our pledge?,['For']
comarg,sample,For,"Since the majority of the people in America believe in either the Jewish, Christian, or Muslim faith, and it is the majority who get to have a say, with respect to the rights of the minority, of course, the answer is a simple Yes, because first of all, this nation was founded by people who believed in the God of the Christian religion, which happens also to be the same God of the Jews, and of the Muslims.  A simple lesson in history confirms that the Jews believed in the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; the Christian religion came out of the Jewish faith and added the teachings, life, and purpose of Jesus Christ but also held to the God of Abraham, and the Muslim, who calls him Allah, also believes in the God of Abraham.  So, since the majority believe and hope that this nation, under God, is indivisible and provides liberty and justice for all, notable tenets of all three major faiths, the phrase should stand.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"I believe that since this country was founded under God why should we take that out of the pledge? Men and women have fought and gave their lives for this country, so that way we can have freedom and be able to have God in our lives. And since this country was founded under God and the Ten Commandments in mind, it needs to stay in. If it offends you well I am sorry but get out of this country!",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"This isn't a question of shaking a finger at the Anti gay Christian community and saying they're not entitled to their beliefs, as they so often think. If one wants to take the bible as literal and believe that homosexuality is wrong, then that is their own personal right. What is NOT their right is using their religion and beliefs in order to back a political stand preventing two people from being recognized by their government as a married couple. I hate to be a cliche, but I've yet to hear a good rebuttle for this argument, but there are so many things in the bible that, if practiced today, would seem horrifying and wrong in a modern society. What gives Christians their own divine right to differentiate between what is still acceptable and what is not? You either believe in the Bible and all of its words, or you accept and understand that modernization is natural. It is NOT giving up on your orginal beliefs and morals, nor is it denying your love for God.  Knowing myself as a spiritual person who believes in God, and above all in love, I find it sickening to use ones beliefs to back up your own hate.",['For']
comarg,sample,For,"Whether or not under God was initially meant to mean the Christian God or not, it should not be considered offensive. Though I have grown up in a Christian household, the pledge has never been more to me about God than it is about my allegiance to the State. The phrase 'under God' should not be taken as more than a simple 'common good.' Despite what is heard from radicals and extremists about God's wrath, the majority of world consensus that has any understanding of the word 'God' from the Christian sense is that God is commonly good and supports that which is for the common good of society. So to me as a Christian, the phrase 'under God' is a poetic way of stating 'for the common good.'",['For']

comarg,sample,Against,"I am against gay marriage and I don't care what anyone thinks. They can call me cruel, heartless, and a bigot, but frankly I don't give a damn about that. I am against Gay marriage because I believe that Marriage is a sacred covenant between one man and one woman. I hold to what the bible teaches about this issue. The real thing for me though, is I DON'T WANT MY CHILD TO HAVE TO GROW UP IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THEY HAVE TO WONDER WHY THEY HAVE A MOM AND DAD AND NOT JUST TWO DADS OR TWO MOMS.",['Against']
comarg,sample,Against,God didnt say that men and men should get married or women and women. The world is coming to an end and in the bible it is said that the sins of the people will grow and this is happening. We dont want our children growing up and thinking that oh its okay to marry somone of their own sex. Next think you know our children will be getting married with animals. Like me some people dont want gay marriage to be allowed and we want our rights to be respected. Like in the word of God it is said that he created a women so the man wouldnt be alone he never said he created women so the womwn wouldnt be alone. Like I said in the beginig yhe world is coming to an end and Gods arrival is getting close and does who didnt follow his law and acepted him as his saviour will not be welcomed to heaven. Only the brave ones will be welcomed.,['Against']
comarg,sample,Against,"California voters have twice affirmed the self-evident fact that marriage is only for one man and one woman when they approved Proposition 22 in 2000 and Proposition 8 in 2008. But in the end, the truth isn't based on votes or opinion polls or mere feelings. When it comes to real marriage, human physiology clearly shows that a man and a woman are physically designed to fit together. Science continues to show that there is no gay gene therefore no special rights or laws are justified for those who engage in homosexual behavior. And study after study continues to affirm that the best environment for a child to be raised is with a married father and mother living under the same roof. Government schools and the entertainment media have done a powerful job of teaching moral relativism ad nauseam, while avoiding the teaching of real science and biology on this matter. And with no rigorous critical thinking taught in public schools, it's not surprising that the younger generation is confused about sexual absolutes and numb to societal consequences. The truth has always been, and will always remain, no matter what any law says, that if you don't have one man and one woman, you don't have real marriage.",['Against']
comarg,sample,Against,"I believe homosexuality is a perversion of a natural/original creation. The question is why?  I believe  lack of spirituality, hormonal influences and mutations are responsible for the original outcoming. Women no longer can find a good man to take his responsibilities as husband and father, and since women no longer need a man for financial support they are given up on looking for Mr. Right.  Men on the other hand , are more guilty in crime, as they have abandonned their purpose in order to follow lustful ways, just attend a gay pride parade and you know what I 'm talking about. I don't like what is being imposed on us by this gay movement. I believe all sexuality should be discrete, and yet they allow themselves to force their views and way of life trying to make it mainstream. If you don't feel comfortable with yourselves, coming out won't make you feel better or at least in the longterm..you want to make society say its ok so you don't feel what your doing is wrong.",['Against']

That was something that was added during the Cold War as a way for us to attempt to differentiate us from 'Godless heathens'.

Therefor, the current existence of the phrase Under God is something that is closer being against our nation's ideals than keeping it, it's just never been changed because a lot of people don't understand why some people want it removed. Also, it's not 'Our' flag, it's the flag of any and all American citizens, not just the ones who happen to believe in the existence of your God or any God for that matter.

Yes, the majority of Americans may believe in Catholicism and thus not have a problem with the phrase, but being selfless for a second, instead of self-centered, taking those two words out makes a bit of a difference to those who do not believe in that specific deity or any at all. And if we're being honest, why does it matter so much to keep it in?      Some might think, I want it in because I am a devout Christian (or whatever) and I want to represent that in my daily life. But, you know what, that's what churches and other places of worship are for.      Last time I checked, being proud to be an American meant being proud to embrace everything America is built on, namely diversity.
