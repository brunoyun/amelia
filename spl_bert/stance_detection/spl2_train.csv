Also to be quite frank, in general, taxpayers don't want to be taxpayers. Many people don't have children and these people believe that it is wrong for them to be paying taxes for education.

So, in theory if one state legalizes gay marriage and the couples disperse throughout the U.S. every state SHOULD recognize it. I cannot wait until states start losing federal funding over this.

comarg,sample,Against,"I hear a lot of Pro comments that wonder why so many Christians have an opinion.  Well first off, the homosexual movement has tried to take a Christian symbol which is the rainbow which represents God's covenant with His people and make it as their symbol.  And now the homosexual movement wants to have the same respect as heterosexuals by legalizing their marriage and claiming that there is no difference between the two.  Homosexuals have rights and laws protecting them against discrimination.  They have the right to choose who they want to express their sexuality with.  Discrimination is not the issue and whether God is for or against it is not the issue either.  The issue is whether or not homosexuality affects society and whether there should be a law protecting it.  Well first off if everyone was a homosexual no one would be alive.  Secondly, some psychologist say that pedophiles are born pedophiles and that is not accepted nor should it be. The question is not are they born this way, the question is how does this behavior affect society.  Plain and simple, heterosexual marriage is the safest way to engage in sexuality and everything else is risky behavior and there should not be laws protecting it.",['Against']

It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other. To legalize marriage between gay partners is to legitimize the choice to disregard a commandment of God. However, God will not be mocked.

The insertion of under god into the US Pledge of Allegiance is such an example of their success in damaging this nation's moral integrity.

Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic.
