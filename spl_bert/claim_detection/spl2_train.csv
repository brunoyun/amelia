ibm_args,sample,Claim,"And being able to post anonymously, brings a kind of shield your identity, and it makes it more likely that you could be willing to engage and express your thoughts in the first place",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"So we think at the point where government is confusing the chicken and the egg, I don't think you get rid of sexism by getting rid of beauty pageants",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,So the first thing that the previous speaker tells you is that the government has a responsibility to educate to six just like the government needs to educate its pupils on any other aspect,['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"And those people are able to choose them recognize that college is incredibly difficult, especially when you are first transitioning, your freshman year frats provide a meaningful community that help people through hard times in right",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"We think that the impact of this is that people will invest much less of their time and effort into creating intellectual property this as many harms first culturally you'll, see a much reduced output of films and books and other types of cultural goods that rely on intellectual property because artists will be able to support themselves anymore",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"When the federal government forces schools to take certain actions very bad things happen is essential that schools have control over their own curriculum and over their own time, when the federal government gets involved, the act with a new one, it is impossible to regulate every single school in the fact of way we would say that schools in poverty, it schools in low income areas which do not have access to ample physical education equipment and who do not have the resources to watch kids all going outside at the same time, probably do not need physical education",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,The reason why the government is a better actor in many cases them private actors is because there's democratic control over the government,['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,So even beyond just the pragmatic impacts of what this policy entails we think there's a problematic signal sent from the state that then creates a societal discursive shift that is problematic for the individuals that are now going to be are losing their legal protections prod to oppose,['Claim']

ibm_args,sample,Claim,"So this is going to mean that people are still going to get cosmetic surgery, but it's going to be let's",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"Our third and final argument is that most countries around the world, perhaps all are signatories of international agreements which prohibit the creation and distribution of certain illegal drugs, and that marijuana is one of them",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"It is still a woman's right to model herself in the male gaze, even if it is something that is bad for society writ large, we think this is about the individual woman's choice and what empowers her not about societal reaction, two main areas of clash, the first on the standards of a ban it is generally accepted that a democratic government can ban something if there is either a large personal harm that requires paternalism, or if large third party harms that allows you to personalize an individual's choices will says but society in the reinforcement of stereo types",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"And this is for a couple of reasons, first and foremost, because the younger people are less likely to be mature they're, more likely going to act irresponsibly when they're under the influence of alcohol",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"We should not ban beauty pageants and just to be clear what we're defending on our side, we would be fine with having a minimum age to enter beauty pageants, but we think that it would be wrong to categorically banned them completely and society",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,The nature of the internet is that no one country can regulate it,['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"But secondly, on empowerment, what anything cosmetic surgery can actually be a good thing",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,Our second point is that banning anonymous posting is completely unenforceable,['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"Then if we wait and let the market decide what we should adopt our second argument is that government money is fungible what we mean by this is that giving money to corporations is not preferable to giving money to the american people recognize that this is basically corporate welfare, you say, if you do the kind of production that we want we will subsidize you will give you some money back but that's money that isn't going to other programs like snap or wake which are important american social welfare programs",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"They don't understand, they can't conceptualize what brain damage looks like, or what a lifetime of being addicted to alcohol might look like, and also we have to protect them until they can consent into those protect potential harms",['Claim']

ibm_args,sample,Claim,"We also just think the problem on their side of the house is that like if the person cares enough they'll find a way to do it, even if it's not the black market like things like waist, trainers can have awful affect your health bilik shifting your bones around in a way that like a regular tummy talk never would second the we want to talk about research benefits because recognize that because there is more money in cosmetic surgery so rich people pay more money so they can look prettier than a lot of the time it actually the discoveries made actually flow over to the areas that have less money",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"So we think that generally speaking when third party harms occur on a band is justified because even if people are allowed to consent into harm upon themselves, you are not allowed to consent other people into harm's",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"So what we're gonna do with the rest of this debate is explain the impacts of alcohol on youth and explain why it's so crucial that while children are still developing, they are not given free rein in free access to alcohol",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"This is very important because alcohol is proven to mess up your brain, a lot of ways to stunt its ability to grow to kill to kill aspects of it and that's a really big problem, because when they're there for when you allow people to take alcohol, a young age you're, essentially allowing them to poison their development, which is obviously not something that we should walk this second thing though, is that due to will do to the increase lack of maturity, that's more likely to be present in younger people there's more of a likelihood that you're going to experience the worst aspects of alcohol",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"I need the electoral college in that regard because it provides a capacity to ensure that small states to just get bulldozed by like new york, california and texas, all the time it's really important to ensure that like little wyoming actually has its voice heard in people at the federal level actually care about the opinions of people from wyoming given that we think it's really unfair to adopt a system that is almost certain to just completely ignore whatever the will of you know why omens are so our second independent point is fraud that fraud is easier to commit or popular vote in the reason for this is that under the electoral college, your system for voting is divided into silos that is lots of different individual parables systems that you vote in",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"Our first independent point, which I think really cuts to the meat of almost everything that government tells you is that specifically banning cosmetic surgery on the basis that it perpetuates misogynist norms is itself blaming women and victims broadly arm for the you know, damage that is inflicted upon them when we hear from government specifically the line that we need to ban cosmetic surgery, you know, because this is this socially harmful practice that can drives artificial beauty norms",['Claim']

ibm_args,sample,Claim,"So first I'm, like a principled level, the idea of libertarianism is that were most free if there's minimal state intervention, we have ownership over our own property, but I think the problem is that when you have minimal state intervention, things you don't actually even achieve the outcome of people being most free",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"And our final point is about boxing a serious concern in many online communities is that people will release the real identities of anonymous posters when you ban anonymous posting effectively, you docks everyone suddenly all of the posts made previously by anonymous users are going to be attached to a name, even if the person made them under the impression that those posted remain anonymous and moral for anyone who was a free to being docks will now be unable to make similar posts in the future, whether they be closeted or politically subversive because now effectively, everyone is stocks",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"For example, if you created a song, if you're a songwriter, you made the song, we think that you should have the ability to determine where that song is played and who gets to use it, for example, many people don't allow politicians to use their music because they are so scene with that music and their brand is associated with that music and they don't want to be politicized or they disagree politician and we can doesn't hardly fair and without intellectual property rights instances like that would not allow the creator to be protected",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"We think that any attempt to fight global warming, which is generally unpopular will always fail, and as such ought not be adopted",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,And that means that I actually am entitled to the existence of this to the ownership over this thing that I created that,['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,This is the reason we live in the most peaceful time in history is that powerful countries around the world are unable to be forced into an untenable position by the international community,['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"Our third and final independent point is that it kills start ups on both in the tech world, and then just sort of like, generally like things like the music industry and the business world at large almost when property rights aren't protected, usually the thing the firm that can bring a product to the market first is the bigger more powerful one",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,Second independent argument is that principally people should just have intellectual property rights because they created these things on government,['Claim']

ibm_args,sample,Claim,"And although many individuals like to pretend as the bio fuels are more efficient or better for the environment, most bio fuels are actually worse than fossil fuels",['Claim']

ibm_args,sample,Claim,We think that intellectual property rights ensure that creators get to profit off of their efforts to get to profit off of their intellectual property,['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"I have two arguments in today's debate first, why it's preferable to jail and large fines and secondly, on how social determination is good, but first some free for bottle I for opponents first argument is that there's a right to be me, and I would agree there's, some right to be me in and out of shot, such we give the court's judicial independence and judicial jurisdiction and discretion which allows them to decide what is truly a criminal offense",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,So we think that it's particularly problematic to put children in a position where they are more subject to sort of like bullying and social pressures,['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"And I don't think that getting rid of france is actually going to change a whole lot as far as like the way that like women feel safe on campus, probably much more effective would be just like trying to make it so that men are less likely to be problematic, rather than just trying to ban organizations that part that might contribute to these kinds of things are not really attacking the root cause of the problem you're just kind of attracting like attacking a symptom of it or like a method of it, but I think also beyond that, obviously, there's other organizations that operate similarly, there is teasing and like parties and things like that for sports teams like on other clubs and things like that do that to like the brand is to beat teams from parties before like",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"The lithium ion batteries are becoming more and more sophisticated, which means that the cost curve for producing solar power is much lower than that of wind power it's simply a more affect of way of storing and holding energy and it's more applicable to smaller scale",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Claim,"We think that scholarships money in recruitment for jobs like colleges often happen at beauty, pageants people have a right to go for that like I'd like to go to my overview",['Claim']
ibm_args,sample,Non-claim,"Movements have independently if we can show you that the government cannot interfere, and we can still get a lack of those bad norms, and we automatically win this round because that's what tim is been banking so much on so recognize that in so far as we have these occasional movements for saying, look young women, love yourself, no matter what and a lot of people responding to them",['Non-claim']

ibm_args,sample,Non-claim,"So obviously, like you can't just like fully regulate these kinds of behaviors on it's simply impossible thing to do, and it would be an unfair thing to do because ultimately fracking gauge in similar behaviors to a lot of other entities",['Non-claim']
ibm_args,sample,Non-claim,"This is important because in so far as there is any grounds for needing this, we think that there should be a positive right to accessing the procedure recognize that this isn't a popular option it's like point two percent of all abortions and there's a good reason for that, not just the ban",['Non-claim']
ibm_args,sample,Non-claim,"It is a lot more physically damaging to me oftentimes cost just as much and I'm still meeting the same beauty stereo types, women who have too much money for their own good and hate their bodies are going to find a way to satisfy those standards regardless what this round is about is whether or not they ought be able to choose the method by which they do so and whether paternalism is justified, we tell you that we prefer a safer way more than that",['Non-claim']
ibm_args,sample,Non-claim,"And the second argument made by danielle is that's easy and excludes other options, such as multi lateral or direct negotiations and he's, and he seems to think that these are better because they are smaller deals in scope, they're faster to agree upon and negotiate like better terms",['Non-claim']
