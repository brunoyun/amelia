Marriage is part of the pursuit of happiness for many people, and if a gay person wants to get married, they should be able to.

If marriage becomes about sexual appetite then what comes next? Incest, bestiality, polygamy, prostitution, rape. Secondly, marriage is not a natural right. We cannot do whatever makes us happy. If I want to go slit a dog's throat and put it on a stake, I can't do that because it's not right. It might make me happy, but what does that matter in life? We can't always get what we want, or simply do what makes us happy because it makes us happy. This only leads to the slow dissolution of our society.

A loving gay couple should be entitled to all the rights of marriage.  The other aspect of marriage is the church.  The state can never compel any church to marry a gay couple.  Plain and simple.

Human experience and a vast body of social science research show that children do best in married, mother-father households..Bologna!!There is no solid evidence saying that gay couples put children in an unstable environment children need love and acceptance it doesn't matter what your sexual orientation is if you are capable of being responsible and compassionate- there are many good married Christian parents who abuse and shame their children- Children need positive role models not intolerance and a morality that picks and chooses what's right and wrong, and translates the bible to suit their own agenda.As for Ann Landers comment that gay marriage 'flies in the face of cultural and traditional family life as we have known it for centuries. And that's where I must draw the line.

comarg,sample,attack,"Marriage is a privilege granted by the government with many stipulations. Love has never been a factor. Marriage is divided among gender lines, not love lines, because only men and women can reproduce. In a time when many countries are facing below-replacement birth rates, we should be encouraging marriage, not dividing and weakening it.  Gay marriage advocates use emotional rhetoric to bypass the fact that children raised by gays are more likely to be gay themselves. Common sense demands it, and studies prove it. Sexuality is in large part a learned trait, and can be influenced over time just like someone's weight. Furthermore, the (primarily atheist) forces behind gay marriage seek to end marriage completely, since they see it as a religious ideology. This is shown by the low proportion of gay marriages performed and children raised in countries where gay marriage has been legal for some time.   It is not an accident that marriage has been between men and women for all of human history. Gay marriage advocates are not original in their beliefs. Other societies have tried to change marriage to suit their beliefs, and they have either stagnated or failed.

If marriage becomes anything that anyone wants because they want validation for their lifestyle, then the definition is meaningless. For those who don't believe in marriage (male and female for example), why not have the federal government grant benefits (taxes, soc. sec, etc.) to common-law sitiuations? How about if 5 women married 3 men...all should get benefits? What if 1 or 2 want to leave the marriage are the others still married, or will it be required that legal documents be redone? Will children of those marriages have 5 Mommies and 3 Daddies? Who gets the child, if there is a divorce and the child was adopted? Why not allow first cousins, brothers and sisters to marry ( if they are sterile) ? Why not? They may love each other and they may not be able to help it.
