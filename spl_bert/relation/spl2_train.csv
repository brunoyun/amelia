mtp1,sample,attack,"but political power also brings about political responsibility, in this case the responsibility to protect the Ukrainian people from the rather strong interests of the two Great Powers.",['attack'],"Indeed one could argue that a country has to deal with internal political changes itself, The EU should exert influence on the political events in Ukraine."
mtp1,sample,attack,"but once they have to dig into their pockets, their laziness will sure vanish!",['attack'],"Of course, first they'd actually need to be caught in the act by public order officers, Higher fines are therefore the right measure against negligent, lazy or simply thoughtless dog owners."

mtp1,sample,attack,"That shouldn't be an issue though, given the sheer number of programmes and stations that essentially show the same things anyway.",['attack'],"Nevertheless one has to point out that there'd probably be way fewer stations if it weren’t the whole of Germany that’s obliged to pay. Considering what's on television these days, it would be appropriate to only have those people pay who actually (want to) follow the programming."

mtp1,sample,attack,then again supermarkets and large shopping centres dominate the market today already.,['attack'],"Owner-run shops may potentially be overwhelmed by additional work times on Sundays and holidays, Opening on Sundays and holidays would therefore help both customers and shops."
mtp1,sample,attack,"But as long as the licence payers have no say in the distribution of the funds, the fee quite rightly annoys them.",['attack'],The TV & radio licence enables economically independent journalism. Not everyone should be obliged to pay the TV & radio licence.

mtp1,sample,attack,"If Germany were to introduce the death penalty, convicted felons could not be paroled or break out of prison and commit new felonies.",['attack'],We don't need it.
mtp1,sample,attack,"However, the fact is that we pharmacists are legally required to inform the patients and possess the same subject matter expertise as doctors.",['attack'],Many opponents of the pill point out that this does away with the consultation at the doctor's and many women take it unnecessarily.

In all states, it is illegal to attempt to marry more than one person, or even to pass off more than one person as one's spouse. Some states restrict the marriage of people suffering from syphilis or other venereal diseases.

There are actually many self proclaimed homosexuals who do currently engage in traditional marriage (and raise families, etc.) This is proof that homosexuals are not restricted from marriage (as defined between man and woman) I truly believe that the powers behind the cause to re-define marriage stem from a stronger desire to attack a religious institution that does not support homosexuality, rather than a desire to achieve the same benefits as marriage for same sex couples.

Homosexuals have rights and laws protecting them against discrimination.  They have the right to choose who they want to express their sexuality with.

The issue is whether or not homosexuality affects society and whether there should be a law protecting it.  Well first off if everyone was a homosexual no one would be alive.  Secondly, some psychologist say that pedophiles are born pedophiles and that is not accepted nor should it be. The question is not are they born this way, the question is how does this behavior affect society.

I don't see why homosexual couples can't just be happy with the same benefits of marriage but calling it a civil union not marriage.  Marriage is a creation of religion and as such should remain defined as a union between a man and a woman.

comarg,sample,attack,"The traditional marriage that is held in such high esteem is a relatively recent construct, perhaps 100 years old.  Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.  The slippery slope arguments is one of the oldest chestnuts to cause confusion and install fear and doubt.  The cited outcomes of same-sex marriage border on preposterous and inflammatory.  No reasonable person could possibly follow the inane blathering.

Secondly, some psychologist say that pedophiles are born pedophiles and that is not accepted nor should it be.

When people refer to any religion, they should be in the situation in which they respect and follow that specific God or Goddess (whichever, one or more) and remain in the boundaries of supporting the land in which they created. If, for example, the U.S is considered a religious country, then if they speak about God, they should consider thinking about what God does for his people, not only what he chooses for being wishy-washy. He can't prohibit something the U.S for being different or because something looks bad or inappropriate as some might say.

Many married couples never have children but still get the benefits of marriage, should we take those benefits away because they don't have children? Another is the promise to be with each other for an eternity etc. Marriage is also about being able to celebrate having each other. And last, marriage is about being there for each other. Granting marriage to same-sex couples lets them see eachother in hospitals, make medical desicions for their partner when they are unable to and ensure both of the participants safety. Everyone deserves the right to recive these things in a relationship.  And besides, not every wedding is in a church, plenty of atheists get married, should we ban marriage from them too for not being christian, muslim or jewish (or any other religion)?
