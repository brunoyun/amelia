mtp1,sample,support,A sad highlight: Losing 60:87 to the weakish Mannheimers in a sold-out stadium.,['support'],Especially the home games have seen the team stay behind expectations.
mtp1,sample,support,Every German citizen has a right to education.,['support'],Therefore universities should not charge tuition fees in Germany.
mtp1,sample,support,it could even be used for social housing with affordable rents.,['support'],"so that using Tempelhofer Feld, which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed, as living space is a sensible idea."
mtp1,sample,support,"they’re very bad however, if the rent suddenly climbs by €100 or €200.",['support'],"If there must be rent increases, there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises."
mtp1,sample,support,A good grade for the thesis also significantly depends on the supervision of a dedicated teacher.,['support'],Due to the many random factors the bachelor thesis should not play a bigger role.
mtp1,sample,support,and constantly declining birth rates are being recorded.,['support'],"The implementation of retirement at 63 is no longer socially sustainable,"
mtp1,sample,support,"Besides, Jochen was given a parachute jump the other day as a gift,",['support'],Tomorrow I will skydive for the first time in my life.
mtp1,sample,support,Besides you're not allowed to leave other rubbish without punishment.,['support'],"Dog owners should pay higher fines for dog dirt left on pavements,"
mtp1,sample,support,Often natural treatments do not put as much of a strain on the patient.,['support'],The health insurance companies ought to be enabled to recognize a doctor's decision for natural treatment and also to cover it.
mtp1,sample,support,for it jeopardizes the secrecy and security of confidential data and informants.,['support'],Parliamentary control however hampers the work of intelligence services
mtp1,sample,support,and how am I supposed to do that when the shops aren't open when I'm off work?,['support'],"Plus, the state wants me to spend my money, Well, I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends."

mtp1,sample,support,"This helps the landlords,",['support'],"If there must be rent increases, there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises."
mtp1,sample,support,"Curiously, however, there are still adverts and product placements on the public channels.",['support'],"Actually only those people should pay a TV & radio licence fee who really watch ARD, ZDF, Arte etc."
mtp1,sample,support,Passengers would definitely feel safer then.,['support'],"This is why we need more police presence in public transport,"
mtp1,sample,support,"Besides, the trading of information is obviously driven by greed of gain.",['support'],Tax data that are not made available for free should therefore not be acquired by the state.
mtp1,sample,support,"as the population in Germany has, viewed demographically, a disproportionate number of old people,",['support'],"The implementation of retirement at 63 is no longer socially sustainable,"
mtp1,sample,support,One can hardly move in Friedrichshain or Neukölln these days without permanently scanning the ground for dog dirt.,['support'],"Higher fines are therefore the right measure against negligent, lazy or simply thoughtless dog owners."
mtp1,sample,support,This is detrimental for Germany as a business location and leaves employers without a transition period.,['support'],as upon introduction many current employees of advanced age would immediately be eligible to retire. The introductory phase of retirement at 63 would also be a particular challenge
mtp1,sample,support,This would simply mean that only those people with wealthy parents or a previous education and a part-time job while studying would be able to apply for a degree programme in the first place.,['support'],German universities should on no account charge tuition fees.
mtp1,sample,support,This would mean that organizations would be lacking a great deal of manpower in the future.,['support'],I am not of the opinion that the retirement age should be set at 63 years.
mtp1,sample,support,and at the same time birth rates are declining.,['support'],"the life expectancy is constantly rising, In a few decades our society will have a disproportionate number of old people:"
mtp1,sample,support,which means that quacks and phonies can practice these occupations unknown to the patients.,['support'],That's why the statutory health insurance companies should not cover such treatments.
mtp1,sample,support,Plus we don't live in medieval times anymore.,['support'],We don't need it.
mtp1,sample,support,The rich and poor live in different neighbourhoods.,['support'],"A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone, however, will lead to a further division of society."

mtp1,sample,support,"Furthermore, it would facilitate the finding of truants, who may wish to get away with fewer classes at school.",['support'],School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again.
mtp1,sample,support,Studying and taking higher degrees must remain a basic right for everyone.,['support'],Tuition fees should not be charged in Germany.

mtp1,sample,support,These areas will be upgraded economically due to these factors (housing health and employment).,['support'],"After the new BER Airport has been commissioned, Tegel should definitely be closed."
mtp1,sample,support,as ultimately this decision is in the hands of the respective government leaders.,['support'],"Yet it remains questionable whether the actual implementation of such supervision would at the same time lead to a stronger observance of laws,"
mtp1,sample,support,"Plus, the state wants me to spend my money,",['support'],"Well, I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends."

mtp1,sample,support,and an unwanted pregnancy can place a significant strain on both the parents and the child for the rest of their lives.,['support'],The morning-after pill ought to be available over-the-counter in pharmacies.
mtp1,sample,attack,so this has hardly any effect on the level of full-time employment and the number of unemployed.,['attack'],Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment. For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.
mtp1,sample,attack,The choice of an attending physician is at the discretion of the patient.,['attack'],They should not be spent on personal preferences without proven use.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Capital punishment is not a solution,",['attack'],"Still, the state needs the death penalty as a deterrent to horrific crimes."
mtp1,sample,attack,Of course it would be nice and simple if after a fun night out with a party acquaintance you could simply take the 'morning-after pill' and feel at ease.,['attack'],That's why a visit to the doctor and professional advice should remain mandatory.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Granted, those concern primarily the British and American intelligence services,",['attack'],this should be clear to everyone after the disclosures of Edward Snowden. Intelligence services must urgently be regulated more tightly by parliament;
mtp1,sample,attack,"Some worry about careless use of such measures,",['attack'],The morning-after pill ought to be available over-the-counter in pharmacies.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Perhaps it is less thrilling for a spectator than for the player,",['attack'],It would be fair to make them into an Olympic event.
mtp1,sample,attack,yet it's precisely their positive effect when accompanying conventional 'western' medical therapies that's been demonstrated as beneficial.,['attack'],"Not all practices and approaches that are lumped together under this term may have been proven in clinical trials, Health insurance companies should naturally cover alternative medical treatments."
mtp1,sample,attack,Parliamentary control however hampers the work of intelligence services,['attack'],Secret services must be more tightly regulated in order to prevent excessive surveillance.
mtp1,sample,attack,"As a boy he did use to scuffle with the other choirboys,",['attack'],I think Fritz has never been in a fight in his life.
mtp1,sample,attack,They do offer the benefit that the competition over brand-name clothes and the discrimination of the socially weak are prevented.,['attack'],School uniforms should not be worn in our schools.
mtp1,sample,attack,Those who do or try to should be held accountable if at all possible.,['attack'],Tax data that are not made available for free should therefore not be acquired by the state.
mtp1,sample,attack,"It's to be noted that in our civilized world, in a democratic country, the people can determine their own fate,",['attack'],the EU should intervene right away.
mtp1,sample,attack,this is precisely the crime that we should not repay with the same.,['attack'],"Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person, The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany."
mtp1,sample,attack,"A fixing of rent prices according to the market alone, however, will lead to a further division of society.",['attack'],Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property. None
mtp1,sample,attack,but is not of top priority for employers.,['attack'],"For a good overall grade opens many doors, The BA dissertation should, if not make up the entire grade, then at least constitute a larger share of it."
mtp1,sample,attack,But still Germany produces way too much rubbish,['attack'],"Yes, it's annoying and cumbersome to separate your rubbish properly all the time. We Berliners should take the chance and become pioneers in waste separation!"

mtp1,sample,attack,Critics point out that they are not using what's on offer by public broadcasting.,['attack'],The TV/radio licence fee can only be required of all citizens/households equally.
mtp1,sample,attack,The state ought not to restrict medical products or medical treatments for moral reasons as long as they don't do damage to others.,['attack'],dispensing it without medical advice would be inappropriate.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Even if many people think that a murderer has already decided on the life or death of another person,",['attack'],The death penalty is a legal means that as such is not practicable in Germany.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Of course there are a number of programmes in public broadcasting that are not worth the licencing fee,",['attack'],"Nevertheless, everybody should contribute to the funding of the public broadcasters in equal measure,"
mtp1,sample,attack,"but what's really lacking in schools today is rather a real sense of community, which would possibly be strengthened by an equal, collective appearance.",['attack'],Uniforms always and immediately provoke fear of losing one's individuality School uniforms should be introduced in our schools again.
mtp1,sample,attack,which is why students also ought to be involved in this cost factor.,['attack'],Therefore universities should not charge tuition fees in Germany.
mtp1,sample,attack,"However, the effort required for the individual equally weighted modules differs strongly.",['attack'],That's why it makes sense that the bachelor thesis only makes up a relatively small portion of the final grade (15 out of 120 credits). It would therefore be wise to adjust the required effort for final theses accordingly.
mtp1,sample,attack,Due to the increase in opening hours on Sundays and holidays there is a rise in employment.,['attack'],For these reasons supermarkets and shopping centres should not be allowed to be open for business on arbitrary Sundays and holidays.
mtp1,sample,attack,But what is the good of a wonderfully outfitted university if it doesn't actually allow the majority of clever people to broaden their horizons with all that great equipment?,['attack'],One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped. German universities should on no account charge tuition fees.
mtp1,sample,attack,although they have taken or destroyed another life?,['attack'],"What, then, ought to be done with criminals who have committed truly awful crimes such as murder or rape - should they simply be allowed to live on"
mtp1,sample,attack,"Indeed it's not the fault of the animals,",['attack'],For dog dirt left on the pavement dog owners should by all means pay a bit more.
mtp1,sample,attack,One could argue that an increase in tuition fees would allow institutions to be better equipped.,['attack'],German universities should on no account charge tuition fees.

mtp1,sample,attack,"Admittedly they do not generally prevent you from catching a virus,",['attack'],Anti-virus software protects the users of a computer from dangers from the internet.
mtp1,sample,attack,but this issue should be solvable through a clearly structured preselection process.,['attack'],"Considering their requirements, some video games are not relevant as sports, Video games ought to be included in the ranks of Olympic events."
mtp1,sample,attack,Yet no one should be required to work for more than 40 years.,['attack'],Raising the relative retirement age on the basis of the physical fitness of the average citizen is fair.
mtp1,sample,attack,"For a good overall grade opens many doors,",['attack'],"The BA dissertation should, if not make up the entire grade, then at least constitute a larger share of it."
mtp1,sample,attack,but you shouldn't bother hoping for that.,['attack'],"Of course a higher federal subsidy would be even better for Berlin's coffers, and nothing will get Berlin out of its financial jam more than a lot of spending visitors."
mtp1,sample,attack,"Throughout the six or seven semesters, however, topics are covered that likewise ought to carry weight.",['attack'],Indeed the preparation of such a scientific work is a fundamental competency that must be acquired in philological degrees. Current regulations for the calculation of the total grade should therefore be maintained.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Not all practices and approaches that are lumped together under this term may have been proven in clinical trials,",['attack'],Health insurance companies should naturally cover alternative medical treatments.
mtp1,sample,attack,although he plays very well without training.,['attack'],"Plus he comes to training way too rarely, It was clearly a mistake to include Tom in our football team."

mtp1,sample,attack,"People are getting older on average,",['attack'],"but they are not sicker and not duller because of it. No, the retirement age should be raised to 65 again."
mtp1,sample,attack,However then you'd have a worse overview of which shop is open on a given day.,['attack'],Supermarkets and shopping centres should be allowed to open any Sundays and holidays at their discretion.
mtp1,sample,attack,However it is obvious that the license fee officers are not in a position to check the usage of every single device.,['attack'],The TV license fee should only be collected from those who actually make use of the programming of the public broadcasters.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Of course a higher federal subsidy would be even better for Berlin's coffers,",['attack'],and nothing will get Berlin out of its financial jam more than a lot of spending visitors.
mtp1,sample,attack,"and the mood in the stock market could be better on the whole,",['attack'],you should buy IBM shares if you want to invest.
mtp1,sample,attack,but they can have days off during the week and run errands at their leisure while I'm stuck in the office.,['attack'],"Sure, other people have to work in the shops on the weekend, Well, I as an employee find it very practical to be able to shop at least on weekends."

mtp1,sample,attack,"Of course the camera could be better,",['attack'],I can only recommend the new smartphone XYZ-123 to everyone.
mtp1,sample,attack,but this problem should rather be addressed with comprehensive prior education.,['attack'],"Some worry about careless use of such measures, The morning-after pill ought to be available over-the-counter in pharmacies."
mtp1,sample,attack,"Admittedly the fields have currently become an attractive leisure park with sporting areas for many visitors and Berliners, especially in spring and summer.",['attack'],"so that using Tempelhofer Feld, which offers a lot of open space and is currently hardly developed, as living space is a sensible idea. If however one could find a compromise between green space and housing, then Tempelhofer Feld should definitely be made available for residential construction."
mtp1,sample,attack,"It is indisputable, however, that by purchasing such data the state increases the pressure on tax evaders to turn themselves in.",['attack'],Acquiring CDs with tax data of tax delinquents is therefore out of the question.
mtp1,sample,attack,But that much of a coincidence is simply impossible.,['attack'],My parents say this could also be pure coincidence.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Indeed the team ended up third in the league,",['attack'],Berlin's basketball team has just come out of a sobering season.
mtp1,sample,attack,Dog owners may think that dog dirt is only a harmless secretion of an animal like any other.,['attack'],That's why causing such obstacles must to be more urgently punished.

mtp1,sample,attack,"Rent increases upon re-letting aren't bad as such, if it's only a small amount,",['attack'],"If there must be rent increases, there should also be a cap to avoid nasty surprises."
mtp1,sample,attack,"but without sufficient, well-qualified junior employees there is hardly a possibility for adequate pension financing.",['attack'],"Admittedly the number of immigrants is constantly rising in Germany, The implementation of retirement at 63 is no longer socially sustainable,"
mtp1,sample,attack,"Despite the severe clashes in Kiev, which at times have threatened to escalate,",['attack'],the EU should not intervene in local politics.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Yes, there is a certain risk to life.",['attack'],Tomorrow I will skydive for the first time in my life.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Although Ukraine is a European country,",['attack'],the EU should not intervene in local politics.
mtp1,sample,attack,"But as long as it is unclear as to how this works, the funds should rather be spent on therapies where one knows with certainty.",['attack'],Patients do often report relief of their complaints after such treatments. Health insurance companies should not cover treatment in complementary medicine
mtp1,sample,attack,But surely these costs could be covered by a minimal increase in rent over the course of the entire lease.,['attack'],Clearly the landlord has to pay for some repairs before a new lease. It is unfair and unjustifiable that new tenants have to pay a much higher rent than previous residents.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Indeed, however, it's already the case today that students of apparently 'uniform-free' schools are essentially wearing a uniform consisting of certain brand-name garments.",['attack'],"or regard it as too much of an intervention into the leeway of students and parents to make decisions. A simply designed practical outfit would even out the overall visual image of a school, and direct attention towards the character and achievements of the students - and not their buying power."
mtp1,sample,attack,Everyone should be able to get the utmost profit from his or her property.,['attack'],'Property entails commitment' is one of the tenets of our social order. A constant increase in rent upon a change of tenants hence cannot be desired by society.
mtp1,sample,attack,"and the Ukrainian opposition is primarily interested in installing a robust democracy,",['attack'],the EU should not intervene in local politics.
mtp1,sample,attack,"but also for contemporary Olympic events, I recall curling and 50km cross-country skiing, you have to be more than a freak to follow those more properly than only in the roundup of highlights.",['attack'],"Perhaps it is less thrilling for a spectator than for the player, It would be fair to make them into an Olympic event."
mtp1,sample,attack,but you tend to watch Big Brother and X-Diaries.,['attack'],"It would be an exception if you only watched quiz shows,"
mtp1,sample,attack,even if billions of Euros have already been invested in the existing airport project,['attack'],"BER should be re-conceptualized from scratch,"
mtp1,sample,attack,"and others, such as “Musikantenstadl” and soap operas, are only interesting to certain audiences.",['attack'],"Nevertheless, everybody should contribute to the funding of the public broadcasters in equal measure,"
mtp1,sample,attack,Yet then they misjudge its impact on road traffic.,['attack'],Dog owners may think that dog dirt is only a harmless secretion of an animal like any other.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Considering their requirements, some video games are not relevant as sports,",['attack'],Video games ought to be included in the ranks of Olympic events.
mtp1,sample,attack,women should still be informed about the risks and have a gynaecological examination before taking it.,['attack'],"Though there'd be the advantage of forgoing the embarrassment of a visit to the doctor or a nighttime trip to the walk-in clinic, No one should have the possibility to pick up the morning-after pill over the counter at the pharmacy."

mtp1,sample,attack,"Of course he could do another big ad campaign,",['attack'],and his pool of customers is shrinking constantly. Peter should close his snack bar as soon as possible.
mtp1,sample,attack,The bachelor thesis reflects both the content and the methods of the topics covered during a degree programme.,['attack'],Due to the many random factors the bachelor thesis should not play a bigger role.
mtp1,sample,attack,"Although having children has become more fashionable again in recent years,",['attack'],and at the same time birth rates are declining.
mtp1,sample,attack,Yet this very proof is lacking in most cases.,['attack'],unless the promised effect and its medical benefit have been concretely proven.
mtp1,sample,attack,However there is no substantiated data that this healing isn't simply due to the placebo effect.,['attack'],Many people see proven relief of their symptoms and complaints by complementary medicine.

mtp2,sample,support,"When they compare the games and the excitement of the violence and gore to their real lives, it makes them crave that same level of intensity which makes them act out.",['support'],but they are more violent overall.
mtp2,sample,support,such as the threat of hacking.,['support'],"but there are many security issues with files stored on computers that are not shared by physical files,"
mtp2,sample,support,The risk of contamination by far outweighs any economical advantage that creates nuclear waste.,['support'],There is no solution to the nuclear waste problem.

abstrct,sample,attack,"Intrusions were not associated with the trajectory of fatigue, sleep, breast cancer-specific symptoms, or mental functioning;",['attack'],Intrusive thoughts are associated with enduring elevations in behavioral symptoms and impaired quality of life in the year after breast cancer treatment and may be a risk factor for poor outcomes.
abstrct,sample,attack,"overall survival, a secondary endpoint for the study, did not differ between the two groups,",['attack'],These results establish axitinib as a second-line treatment option for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
abstrct,sample,attack,"However, this difference did not translate into a worse feeling of general well-being as measured by a simple visual analogue scale (5.8 vs 5.2; P = 0.3).",['attack'],Patients allocated to misoprostol did report slightly increased soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and a greater use of analgesics.

abstrct,sample,attack,"However, the trend in RR, PFS, and OS favors PC.",['attack'],"VC, GC, and TC are not superior to PC in terms of overall survival (OS)."
abstrct,sample,attack,"Despite higher rates of some adverse effects (anemia, abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue)",['attack'],the overall toxicity profile of vinflunine was manageable.
abstrct,sample,attack,"Although survival was not improved,",['attack'],arm B offers a better palliation for advanced NSCLC patients than arm A.
abstrct,sample,attack,The trial had to be stopped prematurely due to insufficient patient recruitment.,['attack'],Laparoscopic surgery was superior regarding the length of skin incision;

abstrct,sample,attack,PVI 5-FU + MMC caused more overall haematological toxicity but CTC grades 3/4 was increased only for thrombocytopaenia.,['attack'],"PVI 5-FU + MMC results in failure-free survival and response advantage, tolerable toxicity and better QL when compared to PVI 5-FU alone but no overall survival advantage."
abstrct,sample,attack,A probable worsening in role limitations as a result of physical problems (Short Form-36; P = 0.050) was observed.,['attack'],"In summary, quality of life in patients with DTC and long-term subclinical hyperthyroidism in general is preserved."

abstrct,sample,attack,"No significant main effect of the interventions emerged on cancer-specific distress,",['attack'],"A peer-modeling videotape can accelerate the recovery of energy during the re-entry phase in women treated for breast cancer, particularly among those who feel less prepared for re-entry."
abstrct,sample,attack,Grade 4 neutropenia (27% v 19%) and infusion site pain (10% v 0.5%) were reported more frequently in the ASA404 arm.,['attack'],"The addition of ASA404 to carboplatin and paclitaxel, although generally well tolerated, failed to improve frontline efficacy in advanced NSCLC."
abstrct,sample,attack,The total efficacy of non-squamous cell carcinoma in the PP group was significantly higher than that in GP group.,['attack'],"The clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and gemcitabine combined with cisplatin for the treatment of previously untreated advanced NSCLC was roughly the same,"
abstrct,sample,attack,"The sample size was small, and patients applied a small amount of imiquimod 5% cream (half a sachet) to a large surface area.",['attack'],There was no statistically significant difference in effect on quality of life as assessed using the DLQI.
abstrct,sample,attack,this did not translate into improved progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS).,['attack'],"Although objective response was slightly higher in the TCG arm,"
abstrct,sample,attack,although trends were seen in favour of the chemotherapy group.,['attack'],"Group differences were smaller within the psychosocial domain,"
abstrct,sample,attack,These differences were not significant.,['attack'],"The corresponding mean amounts of residual contrast-enhancing tumor tissue were 29.2 and 24.4%, respectively."

abstrct,sample,attack,Different analyses yielded slightly different conclusions,['attack'],"in general, the QOL analyses were concordant and showed that patients on DOX alone had fewer disease and treatment related adverse events and better QOL."
abstrct,sample,attack,"Results tended to decline at 12 months and even more at 24 months, though at all times, they were as robust in women with lower expectation of effect as in those with higher expectation.",['attack'],"The MBSR intervention appears to benefit psychosocial adjustment in cancer patients, over and above the effects of usual care or a credible control condition."
abstrct,sample,attack,but like other toxicity scoring systems it has not been formally validated.,['attack'],"The observer-based toxicity scoring system used by DAHANCA (the Danish head and neck cancer study group) has proved itself sensitive to differences in toxicity in a large randomised study,"
abstrct,sample,attack,"Although, noninferiority of XP to EP was formally not proven,",['attack'],first-line XP was active and feasible.
abstrct,sample,attack,but the adverse reactions decreased significantly in the PP group compared with those in the GP group.,['attack'],"The clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and gemcitabine combined with cisplatin for the treatment of previously untreated advanced NSCLC was roughly the same,"

abstrct,sample,attack,Further studies are needed to corroborate our results.,['attack'],Preoperative PFME may improve early continence and QoL outcomes after RP.
abstrct,sample,attack,The trial was stopped early because of poor accrual before the target of 123 evaluable patients was met.,['attack'],Epoetin alpha decreased the number of PRBC transfusions and did not appear to have a negative impact on remission duration.
abstrct,sample,attack,"This weakness seems inherent in an observer-based scoring system, and will probably also apply to newer ones like CTCAE 3.0.",['attack'],The DAHANCA toxicity score is an effective instrument in assessing objective treatment induced toxicity in head and neck cancer patients but insensitive and non-specific with regard to patient assessed subjective endpoints.

So I would say first as to the general national slowdown in our economy , which has brought 4 1/2 million people out of work and about 3 million working part time , and the second is the so-called distressed areas , where unemployment is 6 percent , for a year or 2 years .

States regulate marriage in many ways besides denying men the right to marry men, and women the right to marry women. Roughly half of all states prohibit first cousins from marrying, and all prohibit marriage of closer blood relatives, even if the individuals being married are sterile. In all states, it is illegal to attempt to marry more than one person, or even to pass off more than one person as one's spouse.

comarg,sample,no relation,"No, the words under God should not be included in the US Pledge of Allegiance because they are completely unnecessary and cause far too much contreversy for what they are worth. The pledge went without conflict until the 1950's, when a Catholic interest group convinced the President to add the words. It was only once the words were added that it became a problem. Then, the recitation of the pledge became wrong for many citizens as it was now more of a prayer, both to a monotheistic God and another idol which is banned in Judaism. Thus, more and more kids are being pressured into saying things that conflict with their religion in school because by not doing so, they are thought to be unpatriotic. This may seem like a pretty stupid analogy, but personally I think it explains the concept very well. This whole debate is like sandwiches and mayonaise. Some people may be allergic to Mayo. Some people may really enjoy aMayo on their sandwich. But the people who like the Mayo are able to eat the sandwitch without, while people who are allergic CAN'T eat the Mayo.

Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.

comarg,sample,attack,"The traditional marriage that is held in such high esteem is a relatively recent construct, perhaps 100 years old.  Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.

comarg,sample,attack,"The traditional marriage that is held in such high esteem is a relatively recent construct, perhaps 100 years old.  Prior to that, marriages were planned by two families for financial, political and other reasons.  Little input was allowed from the groom-to-be and no input from the bride-to-be.  This type of marriage is still practiced in several parts of the world.  Women were/are seen as chattel, something to be used in bargaining not unlike a prized cow or a fecund mare.  Is this what those against same-sex marriage really want to bring back?  As to the need for both a male and a female, a father and a mother, to breed and rear children:  where do the hundreds of thousands of single-parent families fit?  As with straight parents, same-sex parents are equally concerned for and participate in the lives of their children.  Multiple studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents do as well as those from a straight home; sometimes they do even better.  I have a goodly number of friends in committed relationships (two going back over 40 years) who have children;  these kids are brought up in a warm, supportive, loving home.  Each of these kids (aged 6 months to 42 years) is a wonderful person; the older guys and girls are happy, productive, loving members of society in school and at work.  And, to those who might be so concerned:  of the 34 kids that I know (in same-sex homes), 4 are Gay and 2 are lesbians.  That seems to fit within the accepted percentages.  The argument that Gays are mentally disordered is too specious for words.  In the developed world, there is neither a legitimate Medical nor Psychiatric association that would agree with that claim.  The statement from T. Hansen about [t]he accumulated wisdom of 5000 years is germane to nothing.  The social, legal and/or religious definitions of and practices of marriage have varied widely over time.  Each society, each generation has defined the concept of marriage to fit its own needs.  The slippery slope arguments is one of the oldest chestnuts to cause confusion and install fear and doubt.  The cited outcomes of same-sex marriage border on preposterous and inflammatory.  No reasonable person could possibly follow the inane blathering.

Sexuality is in large part a learned trait, and can be influenced over time just like someone's weight. Furthermore, the (primarily atheist) forces behind gay marriage seek to end marriage completely, since they see it as a religious ideology. This is shown by the low proportion of gay marriages performed and children raised in countries where gay marriage has been legal for some time.   It is not an accident that marriage has been between men and women for all of human history. Gay marriage advocates are not original in their beliefs.
