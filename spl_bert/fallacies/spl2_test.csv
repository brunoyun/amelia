cocolofa,sample,none," Belarus doesn't operate under the laws of the USA or something. If people were found guilty of whatever crimes and find themselves in prison, that is by definition lawful, whether we like the laws in question or not. We should criticize the bad laws for being bad laws and refrain from politically charged and inaccurate language. I think that is the best path towards ensuring the system is just.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Too many times governments and citizens dismiss corruption like this as they think we should be looking at bigger problems. When business men are tied a to a  corrupt government we must always pet close attention as there big problems behind it. We need to tackle and eliminate all corruption and not just push it aside for what we see as bigger issues. Disasters always start small and ignoring them leads to huge mistakes.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Just because the government response is flawed doesn't mean everything they say or do should be ignored. Once they've started to provide vaccines, should everyone refuse to take them because the government isn't great? The value of public health efforts should be recognized, and part of saving ourselves is trying to improve the government and taking advantage of what good parts of it exist.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The government of Lebanon cannot expect to meet the protesters demands by silencing them. They government of Lebanon is doing nothing to acknowledge the demonstrators demands. The government will have to listen to the grievances related to the port explosion, and not attempt to just silence dissent. This is not the effective approach to governance, their needs to be dialouge with the protesters, and justice for them.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," That's so sad to think about all of those beautiful birds suffering. Its even sadder to think about how stories like this will become more common as climate change gets worse. At this point, though, I think its unavoidable. We can't undo decades and decades of harm to the environment. But the politicians can make it harder for companies to abuse the environment now.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I agree with your point generally, but it doesn't apply here. The protestors weren't doing anything remotely resembling ""terrorism."" They were assembling to express grievances against the government, which is standard, protected behavior in the modern world. That's Amnesty International has raised the alarm over attacks against civilians. The people of Nicaragua deserve better.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Don't you think it is important to address this issue as well as climate change? Why cant we do both of them? I think we need to make sure we hold the government accountable and make sure they arent pushing disinformation and arresting people when called out for it. This information surely could lead to loss of life. Plus they also threatened the freedom of the press by arresting the woman. These aren't things that are to be ignored. Hey addressing them is also not going to lead to climate change being worse or add to more homeless on the streets. These issues also involve the government. If they are putting out false information on this issue, what makes you think we can trust them to fish climate change or homelessness?",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Actually, where I'm at, it is illegal to burn leaves in your yard. There IS a fire risk, just like there's a risk of death due to celebratory shooting, and I'm fine with measures to reduce those risks. You're trying to make a slippery-slope argument, as if someone's going to take away all guns. But we can take safety measures and still keep our civil liberties. Los Angeles warns of criminal charges with jail time to deter the practice, so it's possible to respect responsible gun ownership and curb reckless behavior.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," They want to hide what they're doing for a reason! The fact that they want to criminalize people from recording them is like something out of a dictatorship. Transparency is the most important thing in a democracy, especially when it comes to what is happening to civilians.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, It seems like the prime minister of Papua New Guinea no longer wants to discuss issues plaguing his country with the press. Couldn't this just hinder the public from knowing what's happening in the political arena? Why must they add all these new Hoops for journalists to go through in order to contact them? I'm all for government transparency. Unless your president is tweeting at 3:00 in the morning. But this seems to be an extreme example of the opposite.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," It is really unfair that a country that is doing its best to protect the environment is going to suffer the worst from climate change. Other countries really need to up their game and do better on litter, carbon footprint, and air quality and so much more. This is a race against time and there are many things can be done, but it remains to be seen if it will be done.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Just because the government claims that registering SIM cards will help to protect its citizens doesn't mean it's in the best interest of the citizens. The privacy of the people is something that should be taken seriously.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I agree, the censorship is common in certain countries and no need to change now. They can go with time like other countries and let things go without being blocked.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Hopefully this cold spell does not cause the people to start of the slippery slope of denying global warming based on one cold snap.  That happens a good bit and it just confirms people's ignorance about the matter.  Global warming is a long terms problem and one cold outlier does not change that.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, This type of industry is exactly what we need for the farmers in the region. This helps them create a livelihood for themselves. The farmers in Nepal are the winners with this dog food product export.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," But any deportations must be done within legal norms. Since the judge has ordered their return, this probably wasn't that. This is a complex situation but the government shouldn't go beyond the rights it has. I hope the judge will sort it out in a way that recognizes everyone's interests.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Term limits serve a purpose.  Erdogan is trying to sidestep them and should just let someone else take the reins.  One wonders why some leaders won't let go of power.  Authoritarian policies don't serve the greater good. They may satisfy a few, but in the long run they are bad for a country.  Hopefully, the Turkish people will make their voices heard and democracy will win out.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I think I speak for most people when I say that this is not what tax dollars should be going towards. Why are we using government funding an event like this? Tax dollars are for public services and infrastructure, not festivals. When are the potholes in my city going to be fixed, and not support frivolous events like this?",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, This is abuse of power at its worst. I believe that there should be an abolishment of the Lese Majeste law that its only being used by the government to suppress its people. I'm hoping that a new government is formed where it allows its people to speak up when they need to without having the fear in being arrested for doing so.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," North Macedonia's challenging past makes for a troubling present. The ethnic and religious divisions that shattered Yugoslavia into pieces like Macedonia seem to linger. It's a place where a war criminal can become an MP and where ethnic nationalism is part of party's platform. What the country needs is unity among the different religious and ethnic groups, and political stability. This is accomplished easier with the Social Democrat candidate, but the country still has a way to go before it is fully unified. Stay strong, Macedonia.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, I think this law needs to be scrutinized before it is enacted. It appears digital rights are in jeopardy and need to be protected. Consultation by the public is needed first. Lawmakers need to protect the rights of their people.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I think that the article here may be overreacting a touch but it does make a point that the optics of a much larger country as far as finance and influence go is coming into an area that may be a little less well off but has resources that the larger country needs. They are working deals out that help both the small and the large country. Now, if there are laws being broken they need to be addressed, but if it is just simply a case of companies ""sweetening the pot"" to get desirable circumstances maybe it is not as bad as it looks. Is there some other company or entity that the Chinese are keeping out of the area by making these deals or is there some other way this kind of industrial situation is harming the Nigerians.? is this behavior an indicator of what is to come? If they do this kind of business will it essentially lock other countries out? Maybe this is a wake-up call to other nations to not sleep on Africa as an industrial partner.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Eurovision is such a weird contest. I didn't realize that people are allowed to participate again even after they have won it a previous year. I think the most famous musicians that ever came out of the contest was ABBA decades ago.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," There are plenty more than two solutions to solve the deforestation issue in Brazil. First we could make sure that we do not cut in areas that are particularly environmentally sensitive. We could also be sure that any trees that are cut are then replanted, thus creating a cycle of new forest growth. Lastly we could constantly monitor the deforestation rates and adjust the allowed cutting rates in real time, this way we can prevent significant damage before it happens.  I believe if we can all come together on this quickly we can make a major difference. Any thoughts or feelings on these potential solutions?",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," What tells you that the people who won are left-wing populists? Seems like they're pretty run of the mill liberals that the West always likes. And they're talking about forming a coalition with different parties, so it seems like they are indeed blending aspects from different perspectives, even if the more extreme military backed parties aren't with them.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Those that are in charge are put there for one reason. They must ensure the security of the country.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," To commenter 3, some people like Central Asian literature. And why wouldn't people like literature from other regions? Lots of other people might enjoy exposure to another culture. And some diversity in their reading. Uzbek novel ""of strangers and bees"" sounds interesting. I like novels about wanderers.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, We don't know if the Japanese diet has any to do with longevity though. I guess we can only guess. The most likely reason is the genetic make-up of the people.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," These women will serve as a great inspiration, especially young female artists who are so often under-represented in their field. Their contributions are admirable and represent the best of humanity. Their monument is symbolic and representative of cultural heritage and our shared human connection.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I would love to agree with you, but you basing your whole argument on this supposed criminologist is giving me major pause. Who is this Mr. Hank Astom? What makes him such an expert in criminology? Did he study this in university? Could you share more about his career? He is not mentioned anywhere in this article and just throwing a random name out there is rather shady. This is an important topic and it's just as important to bring credibility to our opinions. We need to make sure that these deportations are fair and legal, we shouldn't be making rash judgements and deporting people at will. Innocence still matters in Uganda, right?",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, I feel that this ruling by the court have severe consequences beyond the case itself. These individuals should be behind bars and face some serious jail time. If we give rapists a slap on the wrist then we are sending the wrong message. These individuals should be in jail.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," This has been going on for as long as I've been alive. I'm not sure what is needed to stop it, especially in big cities. I feel for their families. Will the BLM movement help with this? I doubt it, but who knows?",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Why can't people just walk away instead of murdering each other! Hope the people in Brazil can stop killing each other's lovers!,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," This reads like pure victim blaming. How are the oppressed at fault for not being able to overthrow their oppressors yet? The blame lies with the authoritarian governments that maintain such oppressive systems. We can talk about structural changes, diplomacy, and all the other ways we can help the situation. Blaming the victims seems misguided.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I get why people are upset by the reduction of the sentence of a sexual predator. This man should spend much more time in prison than it looks like he will. That much is clear and obvious, what is not so obvious is that preventing such crimes is a bigger issue that needs to be addressed. The sentence is important, but if we can prevent the crime entirely then the sentence becomes irrelevant. I know we are easy to become focused on the issue at hand, but we should also look at the causes of such behavior. If we can eliminate these then we all will have something to celebrate. True justice is preventing such crimes from ever happening in the first place.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," It's unbelievable where the priorities of the Turkish government seem to be. The country is falling apart and they're worried about some TV show scene. This is classic authoritarian government tactics, to distract from real issues with some high profile nonsense. In any case, censorship should never be the reply to shows depicting the realities that many women face.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, It's crazy how the police were more worried about the cows being orphaned over a dying victim. I think they need to get their priorities straight over in India.  Especially if you are a police officer. There was no excuse for not giving aid to this victim. Prioritizing animal welfare over human life is so trivial in comparison.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, Focusing and fighting about a small area of land and mountains while you live in countries with lots of poverty and violence seems like a waste of time. Fix your governments and help your people! Imagine if our military was fighting over a couple mountains. We'd all be pissed.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, Its very sand and trivial to think that we are consumed with how much of a vegetarian nation Bangladesh is. We have wars going on. We have hunger across the globe. We also have people losing personal freedoms constantly. So I think we need to get our priorities straight and get back to dealing with more important issues. Together we can deal with this.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," It's commendable the progress on LGBT rights in Taiwan, not many nations can boast of such strides. However, the global lack of progress might be due to more crucial problems like economic instability, accessibility to affordable healthcare, high unemployment rates, and even political instability in certain regions. Not to underscore LGBT rights importance, but there could just be bigger fish to fry. Yet, despite these, it's quite deplorable that basic rights and freedoms are being trampled upon in other parts of the world. It's a sad testament that we can't handle problems concurrently and particular groups have to suffer for it.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," India has a huge rape problem which is much worse than groping. These activists need to focus all their attention on that before anything else. The culture needs to be taught to respect women before any change happens in the courts. If so many men find it okay to RAPE, then obviously an even greater amount of men will find it ok to sexually assault.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," While it is a real concern for Salvadorans that earthquakes and other disasters occur which make it hard to return home and so they depend on temporary stays in the US, there is a bigger threat to El Salvador. Climate change is global, posing a massive threat not only to El Salvador but to the entire global south. Let's zoom our focus out a little bit and be more concerned about the bigger picture. The world needs to tackle climate change first and foremost.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Rewriting the constitution seems too much to ask at this point. Job insecurity and limited education problems and climate change are the real threats to the young people.  Seems silly to worry about Lese Majeste laws when it doesn't really even affect most people.  The young people's concerns are valid on some level, but they are not at the top of most people's lists or should they be.  Let's address more pressing problems first, then we can address problems in the monarchy.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Maybe it's just me, but I just can't bring myself to care about such relatively minor things like the mild corruption of a political party in some other country. Feels like the world and my country has far bigger things to worry about. Don't really have the bandwidth to care about this sort of stuff, what with all the ongoing war and poverty.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," This incident, innocuous as it is, does raise awareness regarding the importance of the simplest aspects of cyber security, like solid passwords, etc. However, the national economy, COVID, and other factors seem like much more urgent foci for the government's attention. Sure, shore up your passwords and do what should be done to keep the network secure, but let's direct time and energy to the more central things: economy, healthcare, geopolitical issues, etc.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," African countries struggle with democracy. At least theirs is not as bad as some others. They have democracy, so that's a start. Unlike places with dictatorships.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I stand with those who are against corruption and pollution (even when done in the name of ""green energy""). However, their global neighborhood is convulsing in war, the outright leveling of cities and cutting down of lives. It seems to me that more concern is warranted by that conflict than localized incidents of river dumping and political corruption.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," What's the big deal about this? Are governments not allowed to have private meetings with one another? We've got much bigger problems in the world. I'm sure China, the Solomon Islands, and all the rest of us have much bigger concerns, whether it be the climate, wealth inequality, or whatever. Maybe we should be focusing on those instead of complaining that every governmental action isn't subject to complete transparency.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, The fact there is misinformation out there means it needs to be controlled. The media needs to be called out for it. Global education is needed to figure out the proper way for information consumption.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, Why are we so concerned about Brazil's stance? Shouldn't we be more concerned about what is happening with the invasion itself? It is worth noting of what Brazil's stance is but I don't think it is the most immediate issue.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," As usual, governments show that prioritizing punishing citizens that have their own opinions on politics is more important than their country's levels of violence and poverty. Imagine how much better Turkey would be if they stopped this and focused on the actual issues? There's also infrastructure, animal rights, etc!",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," There are worse problems that effect a larger segment of the population. Things like malnutrition and poverty are more important then lgbtq relation issues. Priority should take place. All thing optimally should be dealt with, but have a focus.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I think there are bigger things to worry about here than the government shutting down the internet.  It can go too far, but you have to give the government credit for trying to keep thing under control, because, if they didn't, chaos would ensue.  Maybe a compromise would work. Let people have internet access in a certain time range of the day.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," While I do think there should be an investigation into Karma's death, it's important to recognize that he had been jailed for lengthy periods of time in his life for merely raising a flag. The real issue is West Papua's serious human rights issues that it needs to address. Focusing on Karma and not the larger system of oppression will let that system continue. That's what Karma himself would've wanted.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," While this is definitely something that need to change, I feel like India has more urgent issues to grapple with. How can they be focused on anything but the abject poverty so many of their citizens are living under? I really believe that when the major problems facing all segments of the population are solved, it makes solving the ones concerning certain segments so much easier.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I think that we need to focus on the worst countries first, such as Syria and North Korea. I think that the only way to address the issue of freedom is to tackle the worst instances first. Turkmenistan may be low on the list of freedom in the world, but we need to systematically address countries at the bottom of the list first, to solve this issue.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Nicaraguans are suffering under a terrible economy, and they are one of the poorest countries in Latin America. So while I agree that journalists and protesters should not have their rights violated and the internet shouldn't be spooned around with by the government, surely the bigger fish to fry is their crippled economy and devastating poverty. Let's focus on survival first, then we can discuss more tertiary matters. Having all your human rights is great but being able to eat is even better.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," There are more important things to worry about instead of global warming. You can try and worry about it, but things are more important than that. Look at all of the kids we could give a home to and help them out to give them a better life.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," If it is still an issue in Thailand for women to be monks, then its safe to say that all women there also face much worse problems such as equality under the law, etc. Maybe women should focus on the sexism that affects all women there before they try to change religious issues like becoming a monk. Focus on how men treat women in relationships and whatnot first. Something you can more easily change.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," It's a good thing to bring the attention of the harm of deep sea mining as the result of such practice is surely to create problems further down the line. Just because there are economic benefits doesn't mean that the benefits will be enough to justify the future cost. But hey, while we're at it, how about we take a look at large corporations with their pollution and waste? That's the real elephant in the room we should be dealing with.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I'm sorry to hear about the chaos and confusion aroused by these false alerts. However, there is outright war going on, with Russian aggression exerting itself against Ukraine. All threats are threatening, of course, but some pale in comparison to others, especially those which involve rockets being fired into your buildings and killing hundreds or thousands of people. Kosovo is right to consider the potential connections there, but it might also want to reconsider its decision not to place sanctions on Russia, since the ongoing war is a much more severe situation than mere false alerts, and things might get much worse as Russia gets the upper hand in its conflict with Ukraine and then Kosovo may have more to face than scary phone calls and false alerts.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," They have a coup going on right now. Maybe they should be organizing to take control over their government first and focus on the internet after! What's more important, the internet or the military trampling over everyone?",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," The drug problem in Mexico is obviously a much larger issue.  I'm sure there is plenty of discrimination in Mexico, but it pales in comparison to the problems that the drug cartels bring to the table.  Also, lets not forget the constant threat of terrorism and war throughout the world.  Feminism is a minor issue.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Why is anyone worried about this when there are much more important issues to address in the country? What about climate change, the economy, and human rights? Not to say the issue isn't noteworthy, but we need to have priorities.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Let's focus on the human rights violations of hundreds of thousands of people. Should two journalists really be the focus? While their rights are important, they are just two people. Shouldn't the larger population be focused on equally if not more? Can't we get justice for them and the larger population as a whole as well?",['appeal to worse problems']

cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Is this really such a big deal? What's the terrible precedent being set here, that you can't mock the dead?

cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Good to have confirmation that it's most likely going to be fine, but why was it ever such a big issue? Oil leaks happen constantly.

A leak is a pretty small thing in the grand scheme of things.",['appeal to worse problems']

cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," While culture is important, aren't there much more important things minorities like the Taino should be focused on? They suffer very disproportionate amounts of poverty, violence, and general victimization. I think these serious humanitarian issues justify much more focus than getting some artifacts back.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," This is not good at all for anyone who wants to assert their freedom of speech online. The government is literally trying to preserve itself by covering up the lies. With that said, perhaps the bloggers can focus on other issues going on in the country. There needs to be more focus placed on issues dealing with poverty, hunger, poor healthcare and bad treatment of the women in Kenya. They are just as important as freedom of speech.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," You say the more serious problems should be dealt with first.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," I hope whether it be in Iran or Indonesia or wherever else, women are ale to get the rights they deserve.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," All females should have the right to legal abortion if it falls within the guidelines of their countries laws.

Many experts will tell you the same, that clear and concise laws will make the process easier.",['appeal to authority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority, I think the people of Georgia have a right to make their own decisions and not have to please the west or the people of the Ukraine.  Their authorities have been elected and know what is best for the country and not the people of countries thousands of miles away or the USA where most citizens think that Georgia is a state in the US and not a country.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," It's understandable that people are concerned about the possibility of women and children being held at the camp in deplorable living conditions. However, the people in charge of the Trinidadian government have not yet affirmed that there actually are women and children being held there.

So we should probably go with what they say, reserving judgment until they have given a clearer statement.",['appeal to authority']

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," Elected leaders have the right to describe the fight against a pandemic as a ""war"" if that is what they think will help the effort (and therefore the people) the most. You can't elect someone to run your country and then strip them of the authority to use words.

They know what they're doing, and they're doing what they were authorized to do in the first place.",['appeal to authority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority, I have heard many groups online say COVID is a hoax. Are we even sure this is a problem?

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," While the issues discussed here should be addressed, there need to be priorities.

Assuming the authorities are being malicious instead of them allocating resources in an intelligent way isn't sensible.",['appeal to authority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," People must come together and take this threat seriously, like this honorable man. Denialism needs to be completely shut down.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," Win Myint the 10th president of Myanmar might want to consider amending 66(d) even further. There needs to be an opportunity for journalists and citizens to speak online freely. Or at least basically as long as it's not offensive.

I know it's a harsh though, but traditions are pillars of many countries today. Is this what we are heading towards?
