cocolofa,sample,none," In our modern world where human rights are constantly expanding, the gut-wrenching experiences of Gabriela and Nata show us we still have a long way to go. Their struggles highlight the urgent need for strict legal reforms to ensure that our transgender brothers and sisters receive the recognition and protection they rightly deserve. Let's stand behind these brave individuals and their representative lawyers in demanding more initiatives from our government and non-profit organizations. It's not just about providing job opportunities; it's about making our society safe, inclusive, and dignified for everyone, regardless of their gender identities. Additionally, let's all do our part by educating ourselves and others, spreading empathy, and eradicating stigmas surrounding people of different gender identities. This way, we can build a society where everyone is respected and cherished for who they are.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, This is a prime example of the type of corruption that comes from relatives in government. Those that are related should not be allowed to profit off each other in public positions.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," This is a necessary law to bring the country of India up to date with current data protection practices. India has the choice on how it implements the law, including storing citizens data locally. India will greatly benefit by having these monumental data privacy laws put in place.  The country can benefit from the data privacy law, while ensuring data privacy as well.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The US not being accessible to every country is not the end of the world.  When the US elects  officials why can't they  be listened to?  Why is their always a problem with their decision-making.  Maybe Tanzania should examine their own internal problems for an answer to their questions.  It may not be completely warranted or fair, but the people of Tanzania should just accept the ban for now.  They should reflect on their human rights practices overall.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Luckily, there are no logical fallacies in other users' comments here and nothing to challenge or argue with because there are no other comments yet. However, this is so terrible for freedom in Iran. It seems they are going backwards instead of forwards! The international community needs to take this matter seriously and stand with the Iranian people. The future can still be bright. #HumanRights #FreedomForIran",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I can see from your comment that you are very focused on whether the government in Trinidad and Tobago is acting naturally or not. Whether they are natural or unnatural behaviors is not the grand issue here and getting caught in those weeds is mostly a distraction.  The important part is that they are trying to keep information from the public and the press, whether that is natural or unnatural is irrelevant to the bigger problem. Our freedoms must be protected at all costs, I think most people would agree on that. FOIA is an important tool for the public to keep an eye on the government and by limiting that tool they would endanger our oversight. That is dangerous and we most stand against that in an united fashion.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I think the Kenyan government thinks that saving face and being able to act as they please is more important that protecting human rights. People should have the ability to have freedom of speech to a certain extent. Criticizing government officials should not lead to arrests or other actions against the speaker. If the Kenyans truly cared, they would due away with these types of actions. The corruption says that it is dealing with corruption and other issues that they seem to be more important.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," This shows the power that people have in numbers if they speak out, even in countries like this. Use the power of protest and assembly for good!

cocolofa,sample,none," Do you have any information beyond simply some guy who told you? Even if that's true, does that mean none of the issues raised in this article are legitimate? Whatever benefits may be coming from this process, however much it may be needed, it should be done in a way that respects the rights of the people mentioned in the article, especially when your counterargument just comes from some unidentified source.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Yes, it's true that only 70 cases were filed under Article 66(d), but we shouldn't assume too quickly that the number of free speech cases dropped overall. Not all breaches become filed cases due to factors like fear of legal repercussions, self-censorship, or long court processes. We really should be comparing it to the number of free speech cases filed before we decide whether the law is effective or not. Looking at similar laws in other countries, they all seem to experience fewer cases being filed while seeing a spike in unreported violations. This shows that freedom of speech is still being curtailed.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Nearly 1 million people have fled Russia since the war. Do you imagine 'probably all' of them are spies? It's probably more about survival, not espionage. Maybe all those people who dislike the government so much that they felt the need to leave their homes are exactly the ones who need to be trusted.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Time machines and dinosaurs - only in Eastern Europe. Elections in America, where I live, are stale and boring by comparison. Let's hope the voter turnout is better than predicted! And let's hope American elections can find a little Jurassic energy of their own.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, At the end of the day we are all human. I am glad it ended somewhat peacefully and no one was injured.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," This is such a biased, misleading article. For example, it states that the claim of 90% of the country's population being against LGBT rights is unsubstantiated, and then implies that it must be false because so many people on social media are upset. Yet a quick Google search shows numerous opinion polls all showing that the 90% figure is pretty close to reality. I'd say journalists should get back to doing their due diligence, but I imagine they're well aware of what they were doing here.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," It is commendable that Saul is working hard to help other students.  I feel aggravated towards the Tanzanian government for not doing more when they are in a position to do so.  Considering Dar es Salaam has a Braille printing press, they could create more learning materials and textbooks printed in Braille.  The fact they haven't yet done this and continue to further political agendas instead is appalling.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Jordan is answering the internet based on what they don't want to get out. And they seem to be a bit strict. Is there another way to offer censorship that still allows the people to access the sites they need to? The people in Jordan might want access to the internet. What happened to the sites they cannot access?,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Kudos to the journalists for  standing up to corruption, but they shouldn't have self-censored! Telling their readers exactly what was going on and who was behind it would have been best. That way, they might be too worried to threaten them for fear of public backlash. An epitaph is too subtle! Make a full article detailing everything.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The people need o elect officials that wil not be this corrupt and try to supress their freedom of speech. Once that happens, it only gets worse. The fact that no one is trying to overturn this is just a way of letting the government know they take more away from the people. They need to use their voice at the ballots and get the country back on track.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," It is always fascinating to take on board the perspective of another culture and their way of looking at things. I hope she succeeds, not necessarily in convincing people to adopt the views she is propounding her, but in making them more publicly known, so that people are aware of them, because I think most are not.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," How perfectly Orwellian. Release a piece of propaganda in which you state the opposite of the facts, or conveniently extrude all the relevant facts. Will this kind of manipulation and deception ever end? It's high time for an earnest solution that restores a genuine democratic process.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The media here is trying to inject their opinion. They seem to gloss over the fact that the people are going to vote. This shows the inherent leftist bias in media that democracy only seems to be a thing when the people are doing what they want them to do. When it's not, there must be some outside cause repressing them.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Unfortunately, censorship seems to be on the forefront all over the world.  Gone are the days where you could be presented with actual news and facts and given the option to use your own mind!  Every country has something in their history that they wish would go away, but we don't learn from mistakes by covering them up and hiding them.  Whether we agree or not, history has already happened and we can't undo the past.  Censorship hurts everyone. We shouldn't be ok with the government rewriting history to fit their own personal narratives or agendas.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I can understand how they deserve to have their items given back to them, seeing as they were stolen from them. But the videos and recordings aren't really theirs, no? They were taken on recording devices owned by the Europeans. Maybe they could meet in the middle and somehow make copies?",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, I think your comment labeling specific political groups as greedy could be debated by some. Political groups of all types have engaged in behavior that considered by various people as greedy. Lobbyists on all sides of the aisle have pursued legislation that the other side of the aisle could see as being greedy. Please try to see the whole picture before dividing people instead of uniting them in a common goal that we all can agree on.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I think your comment is missing the point, we can worry about the pandemic and the improper portrayal of Afghans in society at the same time. We don't have to choose one or the other, we can address them both without minimizing the other. Sure, we do want people to be healthy in their body, but also we want them to be healthy in their spirit. That is why we cannot just choose one and ignore the other. This film is an important step forward to showing that people are people and should be treated as such. I don't think that should ever be put on the back burner and neither should our response to the pandemic.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The belief that the telecommunication user will be substantially benefited by knowing some details about the shut down, when there actual issues is the loss of service itself. Although knowing the duration of the shutdown is slightly helpful, it does not solve the issue of loss of network service for users because of protests. The customer already knows the likely reasons for the network shutdown, it was done by the government because of a protest or similar activity. Having an official statement of this offers no help to the user, who just wants service back.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, This is an interesting story that makes me think deeply about different cultures and something that I would want to check out. I think it's good work that the filmmaker is doing to try to find the origins of the art and to see if it was potentially stolen. These type of things matter to cultures and the people that they effect.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I admire having tolerance for transgender people, but I wouldn't say it's natural all.  Sometimes, you have to consider that some are just mentally ill.  What do we do as a society when the lunatics are running the asylum? I do think we should have empathy for these people and their struggles, though.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I'm curious, do the statistics actually show persistent racism against indigenous peoples? I mean, disparities don't necessarily mean people are being treated differently. Of course, it can mean that, and I wouldn't be surprised if it did, but I'd be interested to delve deeper. I would very much appreciate some studies or research, if anyone can share.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The Madagascar child protection network of 750 members has been unable to make enough progress in ending child violence in the country, and will continue on like this without action. We need to do away with the program if it continues this lack of progress, because it will continue to fail at it's objectives.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, It is natural for us to try and find anything that will help alleviate issues that come about from viruses. So it is not surprising that Japanese people have turned to an old favorite to try and combat this virus. It's similar to how many societies across the globe use natural remedies. We need to be careful though as these kind of things lead to misinformation.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Just because a majority of people think something, does not necessarily make it right or moral. History shows many times that the majority was in fact wrong or harmful.  Everyone thinks majority rule is great until they are in the minority. Just because there are not as many people that are like you does not mean that they should be treated any differently than anyone else. If a person needs medical care, they should be afforded it no matter their sexual orientation or religion or favorite color. Equality is essential for a functioning society. If we just throw everything up to ""majority rules"" who will take care of you if the majority outnumbers you? Human rights should not be left to a simple vote. They should be allowed no matter who they pertain to no matter what part of society they belong to.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Countries that struggle with establishing or maintaining a state religion ineluctably have these kinds of issues. Iran is a good example. Laws which prohibit both the state from establishing a religion or banishing a religion are best. Let's hope for a future where everyone's rights are respected irrespective of religious beliefs.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, It's a nice story but it seems that these people would have found the glimmer anywhere while the article seems to matter of fact want to mark the dress as the reasoning. Seems to give the dress itself too much credit. After that it strays too much off the alleged point of the story to talk about culture and such.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, I believe that the allocation of resources for informal workers is insufficient. The government should be doing more for these workers in order to help them achieve their goals and survive.,['none']

cocolofa,sample,none," You can say you are canceling music festival and other events for whatever reason you claim, but what you are really doing is shutting down potential for anyone with a different view point to share their opinion.  What you are really doing is ensuring that in the future, anyone who might have shared your political views will remember this and never cross the line.  In the future, no one will share your political opinions and if you think you are preserving your way of life, you are wrong.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Yes, America is always hypocritical when it comes to foreign issues. We can topple governments and ban certain people from coming here, but then we criticize other countries for making their own laws? Why should we care what Georgia does? They are irrelevant to our self interests.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Any country that wants to censor what their people can see on social media is a country that shouldn't be trusted. They will try to get away with as much as possible until the people don't let them. Kazakhstan's president is obviously a tyrant in the making here. He just doesn't want the people to say or read what they want.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," You not believing this is a big deal is why it tends to become a bigger deal. You ignore it, until the things that are being spread are just accepted as truth instead of nipping it in the bud immediately. As the news article states, this hate speech has led to real problems. So while a social media post isn't the biggest deal in the world, it can become one very, very quickly.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," It's quite surprising that Telegram is the most popular app in Uzbekistan. The rise in mobile communication costs and Telegram's user-friendly nature seem to be driving this trend. What really stands out is how the app acts as a vibrant forum for community discussion as well as an information hub. It's incredible how people are even resorting to it for political conversations! I do wonder how this will evolve and if there might be drawbacks too, considering the content that is typically censored there. It's a space definitely worth watching!",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Yes, I agree free speech is important. However, it appears this is more of a copyright issue as Japan has very strict copyright laws. It appears this is more about protecting intellectual property rights. It is important that we respect those rights as well.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, It is quite troubling to say the least that the Chinese government continues to deny the real extent of the events that unfolded at the Tiananmen Massacre. Many people died that day and to not even acknowledge the facts about the event is just absurd by the Chinese government and to censure the information regarding it is even worse. This event did take place whether the Chinese government acknowledges it or not.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Would this be an example of when its morally okay to resort to destructing property? If they don't do something about the dam, they will all die, as will their animals. The government obviously doesn't care. They need to do something, though, even if it could get them in legal trouble.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I don't understand why so many countries in the world still have monarchies and protect them. I get that it is a part of tradition and then want to keep it going. However it serves them people in no way. In Thailand it is do bad that you get arrested for criticizing them, that is absurd. Tradition or not, no one should be protected like that. It's time that those traditions come into question. Many of them are not enriching the lives of the people who live under them. So a reasonable conversation should be had on these monarchies.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, It's easy to see why this Telegram app has become a hit.  These people need a way to  communicate without being censored as online.  Being able to talk and share ideas with others is vital to human beings.  They have new channels to engage in discussions on social and political matters without fear.  I hope they continue to have access to his platform that gives them some freedom of speech in a censored place.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," It is very important that the people are heard. How can citizens be denied freedom in 2023. We cannot ignore public opinion, we must listen to the Thai citizens! The government needs to be stopped!",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," If you are arguing that allowing attacks on Muslims to go unpunished is wrong, I'm with you. However, if you're arguing that Muslim arrests are warranted because Muslim voices specifically must be silenced, I can't agree. That's a slippery slope kind of argument that doesn't hold up and only opens the door for discrimination against any religion.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Yes, this is the best way for him to honor his what happened to his sons. Him continuing to succeed and build up his land is what Adolfo would want. What a great dad he was making those sacrifices for his kids.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, I think the humans rights violations are a worse problem. If women want to join the military let them. What about people having all of their rights violated in terrible ways such as torture and death.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, This is a good way to get the word out to a lot of people but that does not mean that people will change their minds. People do not trust the government and it is showing in the amount of people who want to get this vaccine. Another thing that needs to be looked at is the public health infrastructure to ensure better healthcare access for all.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I agree.  If it's not broke, don't fix it. And the people protesting show that they are not open to the idea.  If its because of lack of understanding, they need to work on educating their people before pushing any Acts through.   If the Assam was failing somewhere, they should explain to the people to curve the confusion.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, What is the process for companies looking to license mining rights in the future and who gets paid? Will local communities receive compensation moving forward?,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I am sure the majority of the Sundanese government would agree with you since net neutrality is benefiting them and hurting the every day citizen.

Individual access rights is what this is all about.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," If the people know to never trust politicians, then the politicians know it as well. Turnbull knew what he was getting himself into when he became one, so he's probably not even surprised about this. Its hard to feel bad for politicians even when they are wronged, because they've probably done it to others as well.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Music has been used to express joy, sadness, fear, angry, depression, and so many emotions. The use of music dates back centuries and this should never be banned.

cocolofa,sample,none," You are right to say that there are bigger problems facing the country right now. We are dealing with political unrest as well as an economic slowdown.

That is not an excuse to avoid focusing on the disaster that is happening right now.   No.   The disaster should always be addressed first,  and we can handle the endemic problems when there isn't a major emergency happening.   What they're doing here is useful.   This song is useful.  Funding for PPE is useful.   We should be praising them for their work,  not telling them to do something else.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," It is good to have an up close look at the presidency of Vladimir Putin from a film maker. But this could lead people to think this is a completely accurate account of the presidency. Documentaries are effective at swaying public opinion. It is important to have other viewpoints in film, and not have such a public spotlight on a single film maker. This can create a very one side view of the president in the public discourse.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," It's shocking to think that according to the governor, there's either the need to ban public gatherings completely or let chaos take over. Isn't that too extreme? Maybe if the local leaders put more effort into dialogue and educational campaigns, they could find a more balanced way to sort through this without turning to violence or suppressing freedom. Such as working closely with the community to develop meaningful solutions that address concerns while maintaining public safety. Let's focus on building a culture of peace and understanding rather than limiting fundamental rights and giving in to extremes.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, This is just leftists wantong authority to enforce their will. Magically democracy here doesn't seem to matter and the will of the people at large is never discussed.

cocolofa,sample,none, Its obvious that they do a lot for the economy if they are one of their largest trading partners as well as make up a good amount of the tourists that come into the country.

cocolofa,sample,none," It's difficult to filter out censorship and oppression in dictatorial regimes.

cocolofa,sample,none," Calling the PM a tyrant in the making is perhaps a bit extreme in this situation. Social media hoaxes and disinformation ARE different than general speech. The impersonal and yet omnipresent nature of social media makes it particularly dangerous. The PM may be going too far, but someone needs to take a stand about what is not just the spread of disinformation but the dominance of disinformation over truth. What the critics here are ignoring is the threat to society posed by the loss of any way to know what is true. As long as the public relies on social media for information, we might as well have tyrants, because democracy can not work with an uninformed public. Yes, we must avoid censorship.

I agree that President Nayib Bukele seems to be rather shady, but there are always more than two options to fix a problem. How about vote him out of office, if they view him  as such a bad leader? If they just don't like some of his policies, then protests can be an effective tool to make their unhappiness clear. Even by supporting other political parties the citizens can make an impact, having strong legislature representation will limit the policies he can implement.

cocolofa,sample,none," It's obvious they only want to identify protesters. That way they can persecute them afterward. If the pandemic was still on, would they have suggests an anti-mask law? It's only about crushing dissent.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Indeed, addressing climate change is a costly venture, but it's also a necessary one. It's disheartening to see developing countries suffering the most when they contributed the least to this crisis. I can't help but feel the developed countries need to step up their game here.

cocolofa,sample,none, I think they want the anti-mask law so they can identify protestors and use technology to catch them and imprison them.  This is nothing more than a way to stop any opposition.

Lowering meat consumption has been shown to impact global warming, so by talking about this issue we are educating people on how they can help the planet. See how this works?

cocolofa,sample,none," I agree with you that we should be wary of censorship by these mostly faceless corporations, Meta has a lot of power and not much accountability. However I think we must be careful with raising so much fear over something that may or not lead to something worse. It is much more effective to note the problems that are currently happening without excessive worry of where this could lead. That can turn many people off and we generally don't want that when we have serious issues we want to discuss.

If we can teach these people how to respect women and that violence against women is unacceptable, then we prevent these crimes from ever happening and move them away from a life of crime.

One side makes it seem like they were trying to help (maybe they were) and the other says there was no hospital donation. One would think it would be easy to find out if something like a hospital was donated or not, yes? It is way too hard to find reliable data anymore with social media accounts that have hundreds of thousands of followers spewing out numbers and scenarios that may be flat out lies to people.

I think a higher form of corruption is happening here and that is what needs to be addressed first. The voting debacle will clear itself up once the corruption in the high office is called into play. This seems to be counter-productive to the boom that Guyana may be looking at with the discovery of oil reserves in the region. I think worrying about how this corruption can derail that may be a higher priority here.",['appeal to worse problems']

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," So true!  With all the rampant violence toward women in the world and with the corrupt authority in place to protect crimes against women, it's no shock women are sick of it. Just the other day, feminist activist Janie Jordon wrote an article about this and stated that policemen everywhere need to be reconditioned on what is fair and right in the world. However, it's not just about holding every officer accountable but offering a training course that can make a huge difference like criminologist John Smith mentions in an article. He started that effective training could reduce violence. I'd say that better training would be the first step against police behaving badly. There are so many other opinions on this topic as well, Dr. Karma suggests online that workshops are the foundation of change. We have to start somewhere and that's from the ground up.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," I cannot wait for this update to the Cuban Constitution. It really seems like they are trying to make some major changes. Especially with regards to marriage that would now include same sex partners. It's really obvious to me that the LGBTQ+ advocacy group Stonewall will be very pleased by this advance. That's the sort of organizational opinion that shows that this is the right move to make. I can see how some people would disagree and make a fuss over this news. But I feel like this is a great step forward and I am sure Stonewall will be there cheering it on as well. We must not silence those that oppose this, but we must try to make them understand their judgement may be clouded from wrong perceptions. I think with that sort of approach we can all celebrate this and use this as a moment to come together. Who wouldn't appreciate a more intertwined society?",['appeal to authority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," Exactly! Something needs to be done and soon with climate change! We are lucky that there are younger generations that are taking this seriously. It's like famed professor Markel Maker said about stepping up when you are younger and how it is easier to instill change that way. If only the older generations took it as seriously as the younger ones did!  Even the scarcely known climatology blogger, John Greens, advocates for generational help to fight the climate change and to evolve the narrative.

If things seem to not improve there are ways to change things by voting and making people aware, but we kind of have to let the government implement what they think is best. I mean, that is why they are there. My history teacher always said ""If you don't like the way politicians are doing thing, don't complain; you put them there!"" He had a PhD in political science and written a few books about the spread of democracy in the world during the early 1900's, so I think he has quite a good outlook on situations like this.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," I see that this topic is very divisive and has created a whole lot frustration and anger on all sides. I can understand and see why this would be so personal to so many people. I feel like in situations like this it is wise to go to the experts whose opinions are so valued. In this case it is pretty clear that an esteemed organization like the ACLU would be firmly in the camp of supporting the right for same sex marriage in Trinidad and Tobago. That is a pretty powerful organization and their opinion means quite a lot since they have decades of experience with such issues. I understand some people will reject this as they have their own strong opinions that may conflict with the organization. But shouldn't we use the opinions of experts to improve our own? These people have spent their lives studying these issues and we can learn so much from them. I think, with their help, we can find common ground where both sides feel respected and have had their views implemented in the chosen solution.",['appeal to authority']

I just don't think that it's up to the government to step in to make sure that people have a safe space to be coddled if something isn't going their way. Overstepping into a crime is one thing, but needing protection because you know your family will disown you once you come out seems like a personal issue and not a public concern.

There is an alarming lack of independent thinking going on and the consequences are already starting with things like cancel culture and online mobs. When did we all stop thinking for ourselves?

I hope that people in the community will hear these urgent cries and will step up and make their voices heard. We need to protect our free speech rights especially when it relates to our government.

Either way it's not acceptable and we must push them to face this atrocity, there really is no way around this.

That clearly is not happening in Hong Kong right now and as our history shows that must change or democracy will fail. We must address theses issues and return to the ways of our past. I'm sure if we can do that then we will find our way back to our blessed freedoms.,['appeal to tradition']

Every force in the world has adopted the newest and best technologies since time immemorial.     It's just a natural progression of human ingenuity and adaptability.   You might as well tell the ancient Greeks that they shouldn't use bronze weapons because it's they're powerful.   You might as well tell caveman Ug that pointy rocks should be banned.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to tradition," The idea of helping out with food aid is really just a short sighted solution to a major problem. I understand that it is the fundamental tried and true method for help for many decades, but it's not the best approach. Traditionally, food and money are given to countries and people in need but in the long run that doesn't help. There needs to be solutions in place to help these people create their own money and food long term. Aid needs to be redesigned in more helpful ways. Like in Kiva, investing in a small business helps level up financial stability and that helps a small part but will help the whole long term. We are a rapidly progressing world, this seems unhelpful in the long term.",['appeal to tradition']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to tradition," I concur with the people of Pakistan that there needs to be more done to give justice to sexual crimes in the country. I think back and find that traditionally these solutions have come from staging protests and bringing groups of all kinds into agreement. The battle for women's suffrage was not won with exclusive support by women, it was with the support of men as well that helped this cause come to fruition. I can see in Pakistan that there are many groups that are upset with these sexual crimes. but they are splintered in how they want justice. Just like in the past, we need to bring these groups together in a consistent voice to make clear what the demands are.

This feels like a symptom of modern society, it's all about the winning and nobody cares how they win. Remember the days when people wanted to win, but they wanted to win fairly? That mentality certainly has not shown up at all in this case, I'm honestly very disappointed by the behavior of everyone in this election. All the involved political parties just needed to have a very open meeting, they could have discussed the inconsistencies and come out in a united front.

Perhaps we need to take a step back and look at the past accord and see how bad this was for refugees and realize that we have evolved beyond this and should accept people regardless. the new act does not seek to change the country or its traditions but to merely allow for asylum seekers to have a home.

I can see this raising tensions, splintering groups even further and bringing overall support for the subject in less favor.

cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," I'm skeptical that racism is really a big issue in Trinidad and Tobago. I watched a program recently on the Travel Channel, and the hotel staff and tourists interviewed never mentioned any problems with discrimination.

If it was such a big problem, wouldn't they have addressed it on a program meant to inform prospective tourists?",['hasty generalization']

If they start censoring basic things like the Olympics and covid what will the state censor next? Nickelodeon? The Disney channel? While they need to be clean, they already are for the most part. These are things that are generally not considered offensive. So why censor it?",['hasty generalization']
cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," I think this article might be wrongheaded on this. Hear me out. The man received a prison sentence! He was found guilty, convicted of murder, and will serve time behind bars. Sure, they might have wanted a stiffer sentence, and that's understandable. But given this one very important data point (the murderer was sent to prison), it seems to me that murder is not as permissible as the critics are saying, or that the legal system is sympathetic towards killers, as the article is trying to suggest. I understand the sentiment, but sometimes a single data point is worth more than all the passion in the world.",['hasty generalization']
cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," Anytime I hear about labor-related news in this region, it's something terrible like this.

cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," The story is horrible! You have no choice but to feel badly for everyone involved in this. I know the article talks about gun violence, but what about the mental issues that are behind the trigger? Every one of these shootings could have been prevented if there was some sort of system in place for people that have these kinds of feelings and needs to safely discuss those. It's horrible so many live should have been spared due to something simple as a mental check-in. I can not stress enough that mental health checks should be the norm! Everyone, regardless of their condition, should have a mental check as a part of their routine!",['hasty generalization']
cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization, I don't agree with you at all. I actually asked an FB group this question too and they all agree with me.

Too many to count. The correlation is there.,['hasty generalization']

Should things like this be brought to attention of people? Absolutely, but to make it seem like it is an institutional or systemic problem with all men in the region may be a bit too much of a rush to judgement. The authorities are working on some solutions and even though it may not seem like it is working, these things take time. I would bet that more men in power are trying to help women than actively harm them.",['hasty generalization']
cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization, This is a scary law. They are obviously trying to take away all autonomy of Hong Kong and need to be stopped.

cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," I've noticed that from all artists, musicians and the like, they are all pretty anti-war from what I've seen. It seems like the kind of open mind that leads one to become an artist makes it impossible to support a war. Svyatoslav Vakarchuk is just another example.

cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," I think its obvious that this is an example of a rich country, China, trying to take over a poor country, nigeria.

cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," It's interesting to see that the WHO has been very complimentary in praising China for it's COVID response. That will clearly mean that they will be praising every country in the world for their response to any disease outbreak. I mean it's clear that the response by the Chinese government was very flawed and yet all the WHO will do is give them roses over it. Going by that standard they have to praise every country loudly for how they handle any potential outbreak.

cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," Clearly, it is extremely important for a country's leaders to engage in public religious rituals to develop a deeper connection with their people. Religion serves as a common interest for the overwhelming majority of a country's citizens and is a  great opportunity for leadership to make closer connections with the populace. For the minority of people in a country who don't place religious activities at a high importance level, seeing their country's leader practice a religious ritual publicly can serve as potential motivation to consider connecting with their fellow citizens more deeply.",['hasty generalization']
cocolofa,sample,hasty generalization," The fact that the Nigerian government would even consider such a move demonstrates that the people cannot trust them.

True, the government is responding to these diseases with some public health requirements. This is not enough, however. Citizens themselves need to be proactive about their health, ensuring they stay well hydrated, sleep adequately each night, and consume enough nutritious foods with vitamins and minerals. Avoiding junk foods and focusing on high quality ingredients like fresh fruits and vegetables and whole grains will help the population boost its potential immunity levels and be in a state of less overall inflammation.

They say that they care about these refugees, but governments always say lots of things they don't mean. They will talk very loudly about protecting the LGBTQ+ community in the news, but when it comes down to it are they actually doing anything? Normally I would say that I was being paranoid, but after reading this story I am not so sure. What does everyone else think? Are they protecting these poor refugees or is it just an act?",['hasty generalization']

Obviously the option of ending all production of greenhouses gases will cause much disruption and changes in our behaviors. If we go the other way and only cut the gases slightly it may not be enough. Neither of these choices are perfect, but sometimes all you have is two unperfect solutions.

Some say that athletes are merely performers, there for our entertainment and not to spread their opinions. Others think it appropriate for athletes to use their position and fame to support causes important to them. In any case it can be a risky move for athletes to go beyond their sport. In America Colin Kaepernick, an outstanding football quarterback, did not stand for the national anthem in support of Blacks in the United States.

One would be to ensure that every country builds her a prominent statue, the alternative would be to have a national holiday designated instead. It doesn't matter exactly what we do in those terms, but it is important that her achievements are recognized and we promote others to follow in her footsteps.

I understand the want for freedom of expression and I also think that the movie should be shown, but I understand why the government would be tense about it, but that does not mean that freedoms of expression should be stifled. Perhaps there could be a disclaimer or some kind of statement from the Singapore film festival and/or the government stating that this film was the view of the filmmaker and does not necessarily fall in line with broader views maybe?

Well, it may be too late to do anything about this census, but we can tell our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters that they are not forgotten. We can show them that we care and support them.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," While it is always unsettling to witness corruption like this, it does appear to be the way things go with people in power. What is more natural than the alpha being committed to protecting his place on top of the heap?

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," Using a bush that only takes 5 years to grow is a good idea for making things like paper. It sounds like it's more sustainable than trees.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," It is natural for people to want to go against a government agency, but sometimes they can see a broader picture of the issues that people can't. Some people only see their society bracket, if you are poor you will be poor issues and if you are rich you only see the rich's issues. Life experiences are what will shape your views. The government, as a whole, should see all the issues and does a middle ground. There is the issue that no matter what the government does, it could be viewed as right or wrong. This is just a reaction to what a person's environment has taught them. The views are exclusive to privileges or disadvantages. It doesn't make it right or wrong, just makes it something else to think about and consider. Same thing with what Anonymous is doing. They are shaped by their own thoughts on right or wrong. Considering others viewpoints would benefit everyone in this situation. Everyone is naturally going to sway the way they were taught.

Just like the rabbit in the jaws of a wolf that clearly escapes its sights, yet it finds itself shockingly with the wolf digging furiously into its burrow.

Rains are seasonal and follow somewhat regular patterns, if you study historical records. Yes, flooding results in damage and displacement, but it's just a natural cycle.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," Well said. The desire to maintain one's culture and language is naturally engrained in all of us. It would be a shame to lose such a diverse and rich history of language. I think it's fascinating how even in this digital age, we are instinctively drawn towards fostering our linguistic heritage. We should strive even harder to protect our identity. We need to realize that losing a language implies losing a part of our very human nature.",['appeal to nature']

That is how our meals were always made before everything became so commercial. You have to wonder if we have stepped to far in the wrong direction and a lot of our ills are to blame for this. Maybe if we turned back things might get better? Sure, there are great things we have gained from technology and we certainly don't have give them up to regain our natural selves. There is a balance that is natural in life and that includes looking back and looking forward. Anyone understanding what I am getting at here?",['appeal to nature']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," It's not surprising that people are so skeptical of the government's version of events. When they're seeking independence from a government, it's natural that they aren't particularly trusting of that government. They just want the truth, like all normal people do. If an independent investigation helps with that, that should be a priority.",['appeal to nature']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," The isolation felt by Russia, which is integral to the portrait painted of Russia by the article, is surely the reason for her reactions to those she is calling traitors and scum. This is the natural response of any entity to the rejection of its ideals and opinions and policies. There is no organism or group alive which wouldn't recoil from and defend itself against such a concert of abandonment and criticism by so many former members. It's a lashing out and a defensive posture. I'm not heaping praise on Russia for this, I'm merely explaining why we shouldn't be shocked by it, and perhaps I'm recommending we step back and rethink our responses to it.",['appeal to nature']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," The memories of people continue to preserve the reality of events, as it is in their nature to hold on to the truth. As they say, you can't fool all the people all the time. Ever noticed how even the most forgotten parts of history find their way back to our consciousness? That's nature for you. The attempt to rewrite history is not only going against the natural order but also invites the natural repercussions, as nature works in its own mysterious ways to restore balance. Accepting what has happened may seem difficult but it is the most natural way to heal and move forward. One can't just turn the existing natural laws upside-down without expecting some form of reckoning. Let's let the nature take its course. After all, the true story of our past is the foundation on which we build our future.",['appeal to nature']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," I hate these sorts of systems, they are so obscene.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature, When people are witness to wrong doings of their government it is only natural for them to want to do what they can to put an end to it. I think it was brave of these hackers to interfere with the rail system and try and delay the troop involvement and movement. The hacking didn't hurt anyone and was a great message to both governments.,['appeal to nature']

Covid has been in extremely disruptive event on normal society. I think ultimately the purpose of what he is doing is trying to soothe everyone's fears but he's doing it in a very crude way that the media doesn't really like, for understandable reasons here. This event is unprecedented territory for all of us, and I think it's rather obtuse of people to expect everyone to act the same way in lockstep.",['appeal to nature']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," It's unnatural to expect artists to give away their creations for free. I predict this website will fail because it's goes against human nature.

Connecting artists with an audience who sees real value in protest art could be a sustainable venture.",['appeal to nature']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," China needs to learn that this kind of behavior won't end well for them. The desire for independence and freedom is as natural as life itself.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," Great interview with Dr. Shakuntala Haraksingh Thilsted, she really gets down to root truths in her work. Most of what she says should be fairly obvious, we have the whole world at our fingertips to feed us. Yet we tend to ignore obvious food resources that are right in front of us, this we must reverse. It is only commonsense and natural to use all available sources of nutrition that are easy and renewable. Dr. Thilsted understands this and explains it in such a clear and understandable way, that may be the most impressive part. The modern world has complicated most of everything in life these days and we need to return to nature to find our health again. To think that she has helped so many people with just the idea of small little fish, it's amazing what small things can lead to. I think we all should take motivation from her and do one small thing.

This is an important skill for anyone to have, so they can feel safe and in control of their life. Having that feeling is as natural as the sun on your face in the morning or your hair blowing in the wind. It's clear that we have the right to defend ourselves and we should help others learn this as well. Such as a mother bear would teach her cub, this right to survival is a blessing to us all.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," Exactly! The whole situation is sad for everyone. It's only natural to deny that an illness it happening when it's just a few people. There's really nothing proving that the epidemic is going other than the handful of people getting sick. It's hard to figure out why people are freaking out this much over nine people coming down with something. In nature, organisms cope with pathogens every day and their lives continue.

As it stands, regardless of what they say, people face a real risk of violence if they do return.

It isn't a game to them, it's their innate desire to be safe.",['appeal to nature']

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," I was disturbed to read that several hundred people planned mass suicide due to Maradona being kicked out of the World Cup.

Most ""vaccines"" administered to people during the pandemic were not actually vaccines, but a new development in pharmaceuticals (mRNA therapy) which concerns many people for its unnaturalness.

It's only natural to want to fit in with everyone and have the same rights as everyone else. It just makes you wonder how far will that end up going? Morally wrong issues will end up coming up with this. It's like a forest growing out of control, it becomes unbalances and invasive plants will end up taking over. In nature, checks and balances are there for a reason and the same should apply to us when we talk about rights. We need to balance the demands of rights with ethical and moral principals to prevent the unnatural outcomes.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," Maybe the bigger problem here is how much people rely on artificial technologies even for things like entertainment. The government wouldn't be able to censor art as easily if they didn't have such an unnatural level of control over centralized databases with all the things people want to watch or hear.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to nature," Good or bad, expressing oneself through memes has become a norm nowadays, it's a natural form of communication. Hence, no matter the content of the memes, it's part of human nature to adapt and express ourselves. However, just like in nature where certain behaviors can be harmful (like a snake's venomous bite), some memes can perpetuate negativity and misinformation. Similarly, while it's a natural form of expression, sharing demeaning or offensive memes can ignite harmful thoughts or behaviors in others. So, while it's natural, we should still exercise caution and discernment in both creating and sharing memes.",['appeal to nature']

They have been pushed for years to not have so many children and now they are continuing doing as they were told.

The people that I know, err on the side of caution on things like this. It doesn't matter where you live in the world, having some privacy taken from you isn't fair. Everyone is entitled to their privacy! First, they look at social media and the next thing that happens is that everything you do is watched and you can be arrested for. I know some countries don't have freedom of speech like the US, but this has to violate some level of privacy. It's a global concern, as soon as one country starts with the violations then other countries will as well. Next, they can track GPS systems and see where you go and what you are doing. I don't know many people that would enjoy their every move being watched and analyzed. This isn't the kind of surveillance that anyone wants for the future.

This situation is more nuances than just dishing out equal parts to everyone. Suppose you told every city that they get 100 liters. Some cities are more densely populate than other, which means some people will be getting more from that 100 liters that places that have less densely populated areas. Even if they give each person a liter, some house holds will have 4 or more people. Isn't it strange how so many think that is a reasonable solution to someone a single person home?   Fairness isn't always about equality, but about equitable distribution and surely a majority of us can see that balance.",['appeal to majority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to majority, The majority let the Chinese government to be in power. Whatever the Chinese government says must be true.,['appeal to majority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to majority, I agree with you completely. Why do articles like this always focus on what some minority of activists or the government themselves claim? How about telling us what the people living there actually think? A poll or something at least? Majority opinion is what really counts.,['appeal to majority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to majority," Yet another way China is trying to snare Taiwan into its grips. Why can't they just respect the will of the Taiwanese people who clearly want to be independent?

cocolofa,sample,appeal to majority," I see that a significant number of women in Turkey are clearly voicing their displeasure at their dwindling rights. Indeed, it makes no sense to strive for progress only to return to the struggles of the past. Seems like a great majority out there shares the same sentiment and it's hard not to agree. Progress should always be about moving forward, never backwards.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to majority," I have to disagree with your assessment. Most people recognize that women are targeted and treated as less than in virtually every industry. It's disingenuous to say discrimination affects men and women alike when everyone knows it's worse for women.

If the majority of us parents, teachers, and students, are dubious, then it's a clear sign that something needs to be change. So, let's make a stand together to demand stricter regulations for our privacy in schools. Remember, our privacy matters, and if so many of us feel this way, it's time we did something about it.
