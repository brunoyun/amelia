cocolofa,sample,none," African countries handled the pandemic ok. Though they were lucky to have low rates. Otherwise, healthcare would have been inadequate.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Why should anyone, never mind a president, go around dismissing charges about crime? What if the CJN is actually guilty? I don't understand why there's such a big problem with simply letting these charges go to open trial and letting the facts and the legal process dictate what happens.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Something needs to be done, but I agree with the commenter who said that too much tightening of regulations in regards to NGOs may eventually lead to NGOs ceasing to exist. It is critical to find the right balance when it comes to tightening regulations. Also, more international measures may need to be configured in order to ensure the safe operation of NGOs.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Why is your line of thinking like that? Your need your reaction that the government should be the authority on coming up with solutions like this is very dangerous. Almost every great idea humans have come up with and not been derived from a government authority, but individuals striving for greatness. Government's main role in affairs like this is simply to referee a situation and Foster a society or initiatives like this are created by individual people.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, This is a great achievement for women. There contributions to the field of art and sculptures are being seen. There are so many talented female sculptors a today. There are so many naturally gifted female sculptors. There work will soon be just as prevalent as their male counterparts who have undeserved dominated the field until now.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The regression of women's rights in this day and age is unforgivable.  If Turkey approves rescinding a law protecting women against domestic violence, that is the last straw.  One hopes these injustices against women are rectified soon.  The international human rights community should speak out about this in a very public way, prompting change and standing with the women of Turkey.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," If there are going to be human test subjects at all, why not those who don't typically have access to good health care? There should be a balance between West and Africa, but I don't see a problem with underprivileged people worldwide consenting to a trial. The problem of past exploitation is a serious one, and informed consent should be a top priority, so I agree that just because something was done in the past doesn't make it right, but I can see how a testing program could be designed to be as humanitarian as possible for those who otherwise lack access to quality health care.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I, just as you, worry when such a law is enacted. It seems extremely unfair and I could see how people would feel targeted as such. But we must be careful and look at each law on it's own. Just because there was an exception does not mean that other exceptions will be granted. We cannot live in fear that one thing will always lead us down a path to worse and worse outcomes. I think that what we need to do is continue about such issues and explain to others why such exceptions can be dangerous, That is the solution here, not to eliminate all exceptions but to find ones that are worthy and fair. We can all think of a law with an exception that made sense, worked as intended and was fair. That is what we must strive for and to do this we must come together and find that solution together. With all of us working towards this goal I believe we can make it happen.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Its hard to say if they think this is the right thing to do or if they are doing it because they enjoy being authoritarian. Maybe they really do think COVID required a war-like effort to stop it. Either way, its bad, but one is worse than the other. They shouldn't be scaring their people even more. They already have covid to deal with!",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Unfortunately,  the pandemic is just exacerbating existing issues,  rather than creating new ones.    Preventing this requires a complete change in how these cultures view women,  and that's not an easy solution to implement.   Real change can really only come from giving women and equal role in these societies and normalizing such equality.    Laws protecting the rights of women and encouraging their participation in the workforce would be a good start,  but it's a long and difficult road.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Voices should be hear no matter the reason and then evaluate. It takes many opinions and voices to come to the proper conclusions. Diversity of input enrich the discourse.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," You're committing a couple logical fallacies there. Firstly, an appeal to the populace. Just because most people are doing something doesn't mean everyone should. And even if some Hindus are rabble-rousers, you can't make a blanket comment that all Hindus are like that. Stereotyping is not fair to individuals. The destruction of the temple is an attack on religious freedom and we must stand up to it! And condemn violence under any guise.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The Australian government is the weak link in the wealthy countries on climate change. They will cause the climate change goals to fail. It is time for the Australian government to change their policies, or else they will prevent the international to meet the climate change goals.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, It is concerning when a government is afraid to have the actions of its military documented. Openness is required to protect people from governmental abuse. Often these actions are defended as being necessary to combat terrorism. But we are going down a slippery slope when we hide the actions of those protecting our security.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," muslims are being attacked. because of misinformation, they are being looked upon as second class citizens. this is a disgrace because no one should be frowned upon because of the religion they choose.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Mali sticking to democracy in times of adversity indeed commands respect. It's amazing to see the power of resilience mixed with democratic ideals, even in the toughest of times. I believe this can serve as a beacon of hope and inspiration to other nations facing similar challenges. Kudos to Mali and its citizens for holding steadfast to their beliefs! I sincerely hope for the peace, stability, and further strengthening of democratic values in Mali.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Traditionally these types of data protection policies have been abused in countries with non democratic regimes like Zimbabwe. There should be a push to remove the Data Protect Act altogether in Zimbabwe. There have many instances of abusive data protection policies in unstable countries. Zimbabwe in particular has used these policies to infringe on digital rights of citizens and the media.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, From past events we have learned that Muslims represent a lot of the terrorist population. I am simply shedding light on a pattern rather than stigmatizing a population. It is no surprise that India wants to limit the number of new Muslim arrivals. It may be of Indias best interest to ignore the protests and to keep the act as is in order to maintain the peace.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Do people really think they need to be empowering football organizations of all things in the name of oppression? Maybe other uses of these laws are bad, but I somehow doubt the football organizations are going to do anything but block illegal broadcasts, like they claim. And should they not? The concept of needing a court order to block a live stream on a time-sensitive sports match doesn't seem sensible.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I agree, seeing a two headed snake must be quite the impression! Honestly, things like this happen in nature due to unforeseen reasons. Pollution or something being dumped in the water wouldn't warrant this kind of change in so few snakes. Remember, there are only a few cases like this in the area. If it was pollution changing things, it would be more wide spread and in different areas. A possible cause to this could just be inbreeding. We're talking a few snakes, not even a few hundred. However, Davis, you are correct about the effects of pollution  but that can take upwards of years to manifest. Let's not blow things out of proportion and assume that every new oddity of nature is a direct result of pollution. Nature is just full of surprises sometimes!",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I think they are being a bit hasty in thinking that closing access to the reef is the only way to fix the issue. There is not one piece of action that is going to fix this. There are steps that need to be taken, including studying reefs around the world to see how they went about addressing similar issues. The bottom line is that tourism plays a huge role in their economy and they need people to come to the island. If reefs attract more tourists, then they need to address this issue. They could do some sustainable tourism when it comes to the reef. They have options and need to use them.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, China is going too far. There was no need to expel such large news outlets. And to give them 10 days to leave was rude. But at least they can operate from Hong kong. If not for Hong Kong then freedom of the press might fall.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," If there was a large protest in the US expressing opposition to Russia like the one in North Macedonia, no Trump supporters would attend. It's depressing that China, North Korea, Syria, Iran, and Trump supporters in the US are Russia's strongest allies. Tucker Carlson's recent fawning interview with Putin is just a recent example. I'm stunned that keeping such company hasn't given the MAGA crowd a moment's pause.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," That sounds like quite the leap, but even if that were right, so what? There are already tons of mosques in America, especially in New York, where this show is taking place. I don't understand why that would bother you. And the bit about it being 'incompatible' seems to be self-correcting. If their art doesn't work with Americans, then nobody will go to their show.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," I believe that Windalco should be held accountable for polluting the river. Its shocking that NEPA hasn't really fined this company for its violations. Forests, fish and people need to be protected from these hazards caused by Windalco. This company should be fined in the millions in order for them to comply and think twice before polluting the river again.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," These Muslims are being made to suffer unnecessarily. Something needs to be done to protect their plight. It's high time that the international community and the UN heighten their interventions. This includes strictly sanctioning the Myanmar government, advocating for stricter laws against hate speech, and supporting compassionate refugee policies globally. We can also help by spreading awareness, so please take some time to watch and share this film!",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," While it's important to make sure that all groups are able to have access to information, there has to be a logical way to go about things. Sometimes having to include every language in a digital system can prove to be logistically difficult. I think give it time before criticizing.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," The situation cited in the North Macedonia example really illustrates the flawed thinking. Basically, their leaders are saying, 'other people are ignoring the rules, so can we'? Do they not understand this kind of thinking is why the problem is created in the first place? The reaction to people breaking the rules should be figuring out a way to make sure those other people follow the rules, not by breaking them yourself too. Does anyone disagree (besides those leaders, I guess)?",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, Social media is doing good things here.It is encouraging people to fight for their rights. Why don't we moderate content instead of removing it completely. Is there a way to balance freedom without risking harm? I think so and I think this is a far better solution.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, What this article is doing is injecting it's western view and value in its current situation to the one in Barbados. This is dangerously stupid. There's certain tradition and customs unique there that isn't in Western countries. I thought the left valued differences and diversity? It really doesn't and is very imperialistic in thought process and this article shows that on plain view because it's so unaware of its line of thinking to cover it up.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none, This is a huge human rights violation. Her hair should be fully in her control on what it looks like.,['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," Things that are beyond a lost language can still prosper. The language may die from lack of need, but other parts of the culture will live on if they are wanted. Keeping records of the culture can be done while still letting the culture change and fade. Technology can help with this as well and can make it hard to lose the past thankfully.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," It's good to know that the US and India will be doing joint exercises in the region. This flexing of power, this bullying, cannot go unchecked. Let's hope sanity returns and peaceful negotiations prevail, so the people of Taiwan can rest a little easier.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,none," To think this is a slippery slope is incorrect. Just because it can exist here doesn't mean it will flourish in other areas. Different countries have different laws, and different rights. It is not one size fits all.",['none']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," We really do not have to worry about which country is the most vegetarian. We have better things to worry about like reducing our own meat consumption in order to reduce global warming. The evidence is clear. Our meat centric diets contribute heavily to greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation and water pollution. Therefore, what Bangladeshis are doing for the world is a good thing no matter if they are truly vegetarians are not. Let us focus on the bigger struggles.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, While spyware against you own people is a bad thing there are worse things to worry about. Poverty level is high and should be addressed. Better use of resources perhaps?,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Though democracy is important to strive for we still have to think about more important problems. For example, let us work on hunger and famine in the world so that more of the worlds population can be thrive.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I think that this comment is a bit ridiculous. The man has been held for years in violation of their own laws and apparently will not be released any time soon. Its more important in this case to see that justice is served and the laws followed - but it looks like more government corruption keeping this man in jail. But in the larger view, this is systematic across the board for all citizens - you can be held and jailed the same way. The law is not applied as written so although it is wrong this man is in jail, think of the hundreds or thousands of others as well that have fallen under the wheel of the corrupt legal system in Egypt. Injustice is everywhere in this system and this one man is being held up as a model - what about all the others who do not have backing from supporters?",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, It is important for people to have a say in their countries new constitution. While there are bigger things to worry about this is a big deal for the citizens of this country. It would be nice if people cared about other issues as much as this one.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Exactly! The way Myanmar treats some religious groups is horrible. On one hand, no one should have to live like that. On the other hand, what should a governing body do in a situation like that? People are coming over as refugees demanding to be considered citizens. Is it so bad that they get to stay there? Shouldn't they be willing to work toward a path of citizenship instead of fighting with the government over being considered ""illegals""? I can't help but feel that there are worse things going on other than a country failing to view refugees as citizens. People are dealing with hunger, climate change, educating the people is also a huge deal. These people have a place to call home, there are billions living on the streets who can't do that. It's just a thought, but maybe we should focus on issues that are widely harmful and not just ones that effect a small group of people.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Of all the things in China to complain about, this? I think they've got much bigger worries than an event where LGBT people play games. Particularly when it comes to human rights and Hong Kong specifically, where millions are being persecuted. More priority should be given to problems that are of far greater magnitude.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Many may think its not important, but Covid 19 is a real threat to society and should be the most important aspect of all decisions. Even religion takes a back seat to everyones health and people should rethink their priorities as a group.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," A low voter turnout (voter abstinence) is hardly a problem at all compared to a crippled economy, which is facing Serbia unless serious changes are made. I would focus on that before worrying about people staying home on election day, dinosaurs or no dinosaurs.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I agree Taiwan has bigger problems than fruit, but this isn't just about fruit. Instead of trying to destroy Taiwan militarily, China is trying to do it economically. Taiwan is right to protect their agricultural sector, because succumbing to China's economic imperialism would destroy their sovereignty. #BuyTaiwan",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, This is a bad problem but the only issue that should be focused on is child abuse. These kids need help way more than the environment.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," There actually seems to be progress being made on these rights. It may just not be as fast as some people would like. I think we should instead focus on the economy and ensuring every citizen has all the basic necessities of life. It is important to remember progress is being made here, we should also focus on the oppression and inhumane conditions in other countries where progress is not being made. Let's appreciate this progress while focusing on the bigger challenges at hand.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," It's horrific, of course, to learn about politicians who kill their former friends in fits of rage. But much more alarming is the fact that two major conflicts are raging on, with no end in sight, both in Ukraine and in Gaza, with many more people being killed every single day. Our focus shouldn't be on individual culprits but also on the larger systemic faults which promote such wide-scale violence.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," So you bring up Western countries and their lack of knowledge of the country. They you say that lack of knowledge leads to them writing stories in which they entirely frame the debate. Don't you think that this whole issue of making it harder for the foreign journalist to come in, is going to make this a bigger issue? How are they supposed to learn about the country and its issues in order to write more balanced stories so they don't frame their from their own point of view? I think that the PM should be worried about more important things that the media. Or perhaps he is, and slicing the media or making it tougher for them to get access will ease those worries. Hence the corruption issues. Maybe if he was more transparent, the media would not be clamoring for access?",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Turkmenistan has the slowest internet in the world. They are only ahead of North Korea and war-torn Syria in terms of fredom. But the good thing is that at least have access. Maybe if the people let the government know their disappointment the internet can be sped up. It's not good that their internet is slow, but I'm sure they are making improvements.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Covid is an important issue but the economy is a higher priority. If we let these restrictions continue, the economy will fall and mass poverty will follow.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," China is still better than North Korea. At least the North Koreans are worse in intimidation of neighbors. They have a vested interest in showing power, so it could be worse.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Its nice that they made this ruling, but I hope they didn't spend too much time on debating this with so many more pressing issues in a country like that. What about the violence and poverty? Spending time trying to fix those issues seems much more important. Focusing efforts on who people sleep with is just a waste of government resources. People are starving after all!",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Focusing on stuff like gender ideology in school should be the last thing kids need to learn. Brazil is a pretty poor country. They need engineers and scientists, people who can contribute to them becoming a 1st world country. Focus on actual academia! Kids can learn about gender on their own. The teachers' jobs should be to teach them what they need to know to succeed.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," While I get why people want to preserve their languages, I feel like this isn't that big a deal, especially in developing countries like this. Don't they have much more important things to worry about? Of course, language is super important too, but I'd be more focused on the significant poverty and violence before that for sure.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, These people are choosing to lose things based on their opinions. What about children who have no choice about the fact that they are going hungry. I don't understand helping those who are making the choice to go hungry. I think our energy would be better spent helping the innocent victims like children.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Don't the people in Myanmar have better things to do than worry about how much internet access they have?  And cannot this man find a better cause? How about advocating for better education and healthcare.  Surely, there are more pressing things than keeping the people of Hong Kong updated on activities in Myanmar.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," These issues should be addressed at some point, but they pale in comparison to the urgency of issues like climate change and income inequality. We should solve the most important problems first, before wasting time on lesser issues. New government regulations and actions could help reduce carbon emissions and create a more equitable society.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," While this is terrible and something that should be solved, isn't the welfare of all children more important? I mean, these kids make up a tiny minority of all the kids in the country, right? Again not to belittle this issue, but just think we should prioritize the things that affect a lot more people.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I think this article really goes out of its way and stretches things to try to relate this to Duterte himself. While I'm sure his actions haven't made things better, surely there are far bigger factors behind why so many people are turning so violent. We should focus our attention towards the root problems that are the real underlying, serious factors here, like poverty and systemic discrimination.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, I think the worse problem here is violence in Mexico in general! Why only focus on women when men are being killed as well? ALL violence is bad and it is super high in Mexico!,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, Do none of the politicians involved care about anything but blaming the other party and trying to score points for themselves? Children are being brutalized and that seems like it should be a lot more important to all of them than the games they're playing. Murders and child prostitution should be a lot more important than advancing their careers.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I certainly understand the distress caused by the implementation of laws like this, when the government encroaches even more on people's liberties. But with Russia invading Ukraine, a situation where rockets are fired into homes and people are being killed, it seems that concern over new security laws may be a little overblown. Perspective is key. Let's tackle the most urgent needs first. First put out the house fire, and then you can attend to lesser problems, like a leaky faucet.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," There are women dying at war. I think the hijab is a lesser urgent issue. They have the right to protest, but there are other issues at hand.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Marriage equality is not a frivolous issue, of course, but the Taiwanese are staring down the barrel of a much greater threat to their freedom and security: China. This is a people under constant threat of extinction, and relations with mainland China have only gotten more precarious in recent years. Let's focus on this issue, that of being able to exist at all, an issue which eclipses that of marriage laws, and then we can think about other, more secondary rights and privileges and etc.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Absolutely, we can't ignore the impact that the rickshaw ban is going to have for commuters and for the drivers. It is truly sad to think of how some families will have to survive. It's beyond challenging, but let's look at the boarder picture here. The growing population is causing a lack of jobs for educated youth and is increasing brain drain on people. The infrastructure that these ricksaw drivers traveled on were strained and not being fixed in a timely manner due to the increase of the population. It's becoming more challenging overall to manage the city efficiently. The ricksaw ban is critical, but there are larger issues to deal with than this. We should also consider larger scale issues that are shaking society.  Our society depends on it.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Is the monarchy really such a big deal? The article doesn't really say much about what the actual problem with them is, just appealing to some quotes from people about how they want them more regulated. I'm sure there are a lot more pressing issues that have much bigger effects on the lives of the majority of the country. Maybe priorities should be focused on more impactful, immediate issues.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," We should have a more civic discourse on things like climate change and education reform - not other people's sex lives. It seems so backwards in this day and age.  There are bigger problems like poverty, inflation, and government corruption.  This is a step in the right direction, though, and it gives one hope of how these things will be handled in the future.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," For too long we have viewed LGBTQ issues as ones that can be put on the back burner. That we are bigger fishes to fry instead of dealing with their issues. It's time that we stop that. We all as people want to be seen and heard. They are no different in that sense. The fact that they are facing such resistance around the globe is eye opening. It's time that we put their rights up there with other issues that get our attention right away, such as global warming. That always seems to get peoples attention.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," Why focus on this hippy stuff as if its going to change anything? Focus on what you can actually change in Columbia as a lawyer.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I feel like if you live in a country like Chad, internet access should be the least of your problems. Don't they lack basic things like food, water, and shelter Focusing on the necessities should come before internet access!",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I agree wholeheartedly. These laws are archaic, and they rest of the world is starting the figure it out. I'm glad the Caribbean is starting to step up and make things right for all people, LGBT or not. Ideally we should focus on more pressing issues in this day and age, rather than still fighting for basic human rights.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems, Ekrem Imamoglu has most likely received harsh treatment from the ruling party.  This is troubling to a degree in regards to suppression. The main issue still stands in that the bigger picture is how will democracy expand or be fizzled out in Istanbul. One person is not bigger than the movement. The bigger picture is the people. They suffer the most. High profile people like Imamoglu may be just getting the political shine they wanted. Meanwhile the people gain nothing.,['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to worse problems," I understand and have deep empathy with the anger, frustration and fear that is caused by lack of water for the citizens of Khuzestan. I can only imagine the pain and suffering that comes from not being sure whether clean water will be available or not. I think everyone would agree that all people on this planet deserve the access to as much clean drinking water as they need. That being said, I think we need to consider the bigger picture and a more pressing problem. The inept governance of Iran is a far bigger issue and resolving that would have a trickle down effect and help issues like clean drinking water. I know with proper reform and with a government who actually cares for and represents all the people that Iran could be the country their people deserve. I am very hopefully that a situation like this can lead to a new beginning where such problems are addressed effectively and promptly.",['appeal to worse problems']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," When I see a major hacking story like this, I immediately become doubtful of all the details that come from parties that are directly involved in the incident. Should we just buy automatically what these biased individuals release to the public? I think not. What we need here is an independent security firm to come in and see what damage was actually done. Too expensive? Not needed? I highly disagree with this and so does Tom Stayward of Tom's Cybersecurity Plus. He is an expert of internet security and he says they must hire a team of experts to check into this matter. Furthermore he is no slouch in the field, he has investigated numerous such incidents and has found the root truths in all of them. He says 'It's often not what the officials first believe, many times there are breeches they don't even know have happened."" I know some people will just want to move on, but I feel we must find the truth. Is anything more important than the truth?",['appeal to authority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority, The dogs should be rehomed in any country with better animal cruelty laws. This is good news that Canada stepped in to accept the dogs. The MABH animal rights authority has highlighted Jamaica's poor animal cruelty laws in the article.,['appeal to authority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," Pretty good news out of Iran, finally some sense shown by their government to have some empathy for their citizens. Illegal drugs are a big problem and there is a lot of work to be done, but executing low level offenders is missing the point completely. To fix this problem we must turn to the experts and the methods that they endorse. My pharmacist definitely fits that bill and he has given lots of great advice to customers throughout the years. He would say things like ""Be careful with the instructions"", ""The dosage is important"" and ""Always safely dispose of your medications after you are finished with them"".  While these aren't exactly the means to ending the illegal drug problem, they are same type of methods we could use to guide ourselves in the right direction. I hope that countries throughout the world will adapt their laws with common sense and empathy, as that is the only way we can ever find a complete victory.",['appeal to authority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," The Buddhists are just following what they know based off various world leaders when it comes to what happens to a country when Muslims come in.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," Turkey is a country filled with religious people, so why is this a surprise? Just because they have traditional values doesn't make them wrong or bad.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," Your comment contradicts itself.  You first say that the protesters are justified in their actions.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority, Making decisions on climate policy because some KIDS think its best is insane. Adults run the country. They know what to do as they have the experience.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," While those of us in the West may be appalled at this kind of governing, this kind of slackness about such social brutality, it must nonetheless be recognized that an elected government is in place in Kyrgyzstan.

cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," A person I respect and admire, who happens to be a successful entrepreneur and not a journalist, once stressed to me the importance of defending journalists who risk their lives daily to bring us the truth. As someone who once lived in a society where news was censored, I cannot agree more. Actions taken against these truth-seekers are intolerable and cannot be swept under the rug. To preserve our fundamental rights to knowledge and freedom, we as a collective society must stand up and rally against these injustices.

Tucker Carlson had a whole segment about it on Fox News where he explained the motive behind the Taliban's surprising condemnation of attacks. He insistes they just want to lull us into complacency. There's so much at stake here, including the future of US/Taliban relations. I guess I need to explore this further; Tucker's been wrong before, so it's actually important to seek out more diverse and expert opinions.",['appeal to authority']
cocolofa,sample,appeal to authority," Exactly! The message of trying to help the people and not being fulfilling the promises they were saying they would, and ultimately not doing what they said they would is too common. Even in renowned political conversationalists, like Professor David from Harvard, agree with this growing sentiment. It's so disappointing to see these broken promises time and time again. For example, in 2016 there was a promise to ""drain the swam"" but it ended up being another empty promise like so many that politicians make. Makes you wonder, who are they really serving?",['appeal to authority']

These evangelical leaders in Guatemala are sure behaving as far away from Christlike as they can. We need to stop letting these religious leaders get away with their ignorant and bigoted behaviors in the name of religion. These fanatics need to be treated as the criminals that they are. You don't hold people captive and abuse them. These people are using religion as a weapon to bring pain upon the indigenous people.

It's about time and I hope that we will be seeing more stories like these happening around the world. I think of my neighbor Helen when I read stories like these, she often would speak about women in business and how it has progressed throughout the years. I hadn't put much that much thought into it, but she really opened my eyes on the subject. Helen is an accountant at a major corporation and she gave a lot of insights of how women have fared throughout the years, she said they have mostly succeeded at high level whenever given the chance. It was quite impressive and even motivational to learn what they went through and were able to accomplish.

I was waffling over which side I was going to support initially when I found out about these amendments. My feelings were radically changed when I met with Tom Sarducks of AAAA Machine Shop and Tools. He is an expert machinist and told me he had been following this issue in Hong Kong closely. Mr. Sarducks spoke very eloquently on the subject and gave an impactful question that stirred my senses. He asked ""If the amendments were so important and great then why weren't they initially in the law to begin with?' I thought about that question and the answer ended up being obvious. I decided after that these amendments weren't needed and all they were was a way for Beijing to gain more power over Hong Kong.

We cannot let this government decide for everyone what is right or wrong. Someone could be considered a criminal simply for disagreeing with the government.
